1089-134686-0000 HE HOPED THERE WOULD BE STOW FOR DINNER TURNIPS AND CARARTS AND BRUISED POTATOES AND FAT MUTTON PIECES TO BE LAIDLED OUT AND THICK PEPPERED FLOWER FATTEN SAUCE
1089-134686-0001 STUFFID INTO YOU HIS BELLLY COUNCLLED HIM
1089-134686-0002 AFTER EARLY NIGHTFALL THE YELLOW LAMPS WOULD LIGHT UP HERE AND THERE THE SQUALDED QUARTER OF THE BRAOFLLS
1089-134686-0003 BERTI AND HE GOOD IN YOUR MIND
1089-134686-0004 NUMBERDAN FRESH NEALLIS WAITING ON YOU COULDNIGHT HUSBAND
1089-134686-0005 THE MUSIC CAME NEARER AND HE RECALLED THE WORDS THE WORDS OF SHELLLY'S FRAGMENT UPON THE MOON WANDERING COMPANIONLESS PALE FOR WEARINESS
1089-134686-0006 THE DULL LIGHT FELL MORE FAINTLY UPON THE PAGE WHEREON ANOTHER REQUATION BEGAN TO UNFOLD ITSELF SLOWLY AND TO SPREAD ABOAD ITS WIDENING TAIL
1089-134686-0007 A COLD LUCID INDIFFERENCE REIGNED IN HIS SOUL
1089-134686-0008 THE CHAOSS IN WHICH HIS ARDOR EXTINGUISHED ITSELF WAS A COLD INDIFFERENT KNOWLEDGE OF HIMSELF
1089-134686-0009 AT MOST BY AN ALMS GIVEN TO A BEGGAR WHOSE BLESSING HE FLED FROM HE MIGHT HOPE WEARILY TO WIND FOR HIMSELF SOME MEASURE OF ACTUAL GRACE
1089-134686-0010 WELL NOW IN THIS I DECLARE YOU HAVE A HEAD AND SO HAS MY STICK
1089-134686-0011 ON SATURDAY MORNINGS WHEN THE SODALITY MET IN THE CHAPEL TO RECIT THE LITTLE OFFICE HIS PLACE WAS A CUSHIONED KNEELING DESK AT THE RIGHT OF THE ALTAR FROM WHICH HE LED HIS WING OF BOYS THROUGH THE RESPONSES
1089-134686-0012 HER EYES SEEMED TO REGARD HIM WITH MILD PITY HER HOLLINESS A STRANGE LIGHT GLOWING FAINTLY UPON HER FRAIL FLESH DID NOT HUMILIATE THE SINER WHO APPROACHED HER
1089-134686-0013 IF EVER HE WAS IMPELLED TO CAST SIN FROM HIM AND TO REPENT THE IMPULSE THAT MOVED HIM WAS THE WISH TO BE HER NIGHT
1089-134686-0014 HE TRIED TO THINK HOW IT COULD BE
1089-134686-0015 BUT THE DUSK DEEPENING IN THE SCHOOL ROOOM COVERED OVER HIS THOUGHTS THE BELL RANG
1089-134686-0016 THEN YOU CAN ASK HIM QUESTIONS ON THE CATECHISM DEADALIS
1089-134686-0017 STEPHEN LEANING BACK AND DRAWING EYDELY ON HIS SCRIBBLER LISTENED TO THE TALK ABOUT HIM WHICH HEROIN CHECKED FROM TIME TO TIME BY SAYING
1089-134686-0018 IT WAS STRANGE TO THAT HE FOUND AN ARID PLEASURE IN FOLLOWING UP TO THE END THE RIGID LINES OF THE DOCTRINES OF THE CHURCH AND PENETRATING INTO OBSCURE SILENCES ONLY TO HEAR AND FIELD THE MORE DEEPLY HIS OWN CONDEMNATION
1089-134686-0019 THE SENTENCE OF SAINT JAMES WHICH SAYS THAT HE WHO OFFENDS AGAINST ONE COMMANDMENT BECOMES GUILTY OF ALL HAD SEEMED TO HIM FIRST OF SWOLLEN PHRASE UNTIL HE HAD BEGUN TO GROP IN THE DARKNESS OF HIS OWN STATE
1089-134686-0020 IF A MAN HAD STOL ON A POUND IN HIS YOUTH AND HAD USED THAT POUND TO A MASS A HUGE FORTUNE HOW MUCH WAS HE OBLIGED TO TO GIVE BACK THE POUND HE HAD STOLEN ONLY OR THE POUND TOGETHER WITH THE COMPOUND INTEREST A CREWING UPON IT OR ALL HIS HUGE FORTUNE
1089-134686-0021 IF A LAYMMENT IN GIVING BAPTISM POOR THE WATER BEFORE SAYING THE WORDS IS THE CHILD BAPTIZED
1089-134686-0022 HOW COMES IT THAT WHILE THE FIRST BE ATTITUDE PROMISES THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN TO THE POOR OF HEART THE SECOND BE ATTITUDE PROMISES ALSO TO THE MEEK THAT THEY SHALL POSSESS THE LAND
1089-134686-0023 WHY WAS THE SACRAMENT OF THE EUCORIST INSTITUTED UNDER THE TWO SPECIES OF BREAD AND WINE IF JESUS CHRIST BE PRESENT BODY AND BLOOD SOLE ANDDVINITY IN THE BRAD ALONE AND IN THE WINE ALONE
1089-134686-0024 IF THE WINE CHANGEENT INTO VINEGAR AND THE HOST CRUMBLE INTO CORRUPTION AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN CONSECRATED IS JESUS CHRIST STILL PRESENT UNDER THEIR SPECIES AS GOD AND AS MAN
1089-134686-0025 A GENTLE KICKE FROM THE TALL BOY IN THE BENCH BEHIND URGED STEPHEN TO ASK A DIFFICULT QUESTION
1089-134686-0026 THE RECTOR DID NOT ASK FORCHATICISM TO HEAR THE LESSEN FROM
1089-134686-0027 HE CLASPED HIS HANDS ON THE DSK AND SAID
1089-134686-0028 THE RETREAT WILL BEGIN ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON IN HONOR OF SAINT FRANCESZVIUR WHOSE FEAST DAY IS SATURDAY
1089-134686-0029 ON FRIDAY CONFESSION WILL BE HEARD ALL THE AFTERNOON AFTER BEADS
1089-134686-0030 BEWARE OF MAKING THAT MISTAKE
1089-134686-0031 STEPHEN'S HEART BEGUN SLOWLY TOFOLD AND FAYDE WITH FEAR LIKE A W WITHERING FLOWER
1089-134686-0032 HES CALLED AS YOU KNOW THEPOSTLE OF THE INDIES
1089-134686-0033 A GREAT SAINT SAINT FRANCESZEVIOUR
1089-134686-0034 THE DI RECTOR PAUSED AND THEN SHAKING HIS CLASP HANDS BEFORE HIM WENT ON
1089-134686-0035 HE HAD THE FAITH IN HIM THAT MOVE'S MOUNTAINS
1089-134686-0036 A GREAT SAINT SAINT FRANCESZ DVIUR
1089-134686-0037 IN THE SILENCE THEIR DARK FIRE KINDLED THE DUSK INTO A TONY GLOW
1089-134691-0000 HE COULD WAIT NO LONGER
1089-134691-0001 FOR A FULL HOUR HE HAD PACED UP AND DOWN WAITING BUT HE COULD WAIT NO LONGER
1089-134691-0002 HE SET OFF ABRUPTLY FOR THE BULL WALKING RAPIDLY LEST HIS FATHER' SHRILL WHISTLE MIGHT CALLED HIM BACK AND IN A FEW MOMENTS HE HAD ROUNDED THE CURVE AT THE POLICE BARRACK AND WAS SAFE
1089-134691-0003 THE UNIVERSITY
1089-134691-0004 RIDE AFTER SATISFACTION UPLIFTED HIM LIKE LONG SLOW WAVES
1089-134691-0005 WHOSE FEET ARE AS THE FEET OF HEARTS AND UNDERNEATH THE EVERLASTING ARMS
1089-134691-0006 THE PRIDE OF THAT DIM IMAGE BROUGHT BACK TO HIS MIND THE DIGNITY OF THE OFFICE HE HAD REFUSED
1089-134691-0007 SOON THE WHOLE BRIDGECH WAS TREMBLING AND RESOUNDING
1089-134691-0008 THE UNCOUTH FACES PASSED HIM TO BY TO STAINED YELLOW OR RED OR LIV IT BY THE SEA AND AS HE STROVE TO LOOK AT THEM WITH EASE AND INDIFFERENCE A FAINT STAIN OF PERSONAL SHAME AND COMMSERATION ROSE TO HIS OWN FACE
1089-134691-0009 ANGRY WITH HIMSELF HE TRIED TO HIDE HIS FACE FROM THEIR EYES BY GAZING DOWN SIDEWAYS INTO THE SHALLOW SWIRLING WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE BUT HE STILL SAW A REFLECTION THEREIN OF THEIR TOP HEAVY' SILK CATS AND HUMBLE TPELIGHT COLLARS AND LOOSELY HANGING CLARCAL CLOTHES BROTHER  HEICKY
1089-134691-0010 BROTHER ME CARDAL BROTHER KIY OF
1089-134691-0011 THEIR PETY WOULD BE LIKE THEIR NAMES LIKE THEIR FACES LIKE THEIR CLOTHS AND WAS IDLE FOR HIM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT THEIR HUMBLE AND CONTRITE HEARTS IT MIGHT BE PAID A FAR RICHARD TRIBUTE OF DEVOTION THAN HIS HAD EVER BEEN A GIFT TENFOLD MORE ACCEPTIBLE THAN HIS ELABORATE ADURATION
1089-134691-0012 IT WAS IDLE FOR HIM TO MOVE HIMSELF TO BE GENEROUS TOWARDS THEM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT IF HE EVER CAME TO THEIR GATES STRIPPED OF HIS PIDDE BEATEN AND IN BEGGAR'S WEEDS THAT THEY WOULD BE GENEROUS TOWARDS HIM LOVING HIM AS THEMSELVES
1089-134691-0013 IDLE AND EMBITTERING FINELY TO ARGUE AGAINST HIS OWN DISPASSIONATE CERITUDE THAT THE COMMANDMENT OF LOVE BADE US NOT TO LOVE OUR NEIGHBOUR AS OURSELVES WITH THE SAME AMOUNT AND INTENSITY OF LOVE BUT TO LOVE HIM AS OURSELVES WITH THE SAME KIND OF LAW
1089-134691-0014 THE PHRASE AND THE DAY AND THE SCENE HARMONIZED IN ACCORD
1089-134691-0015 WORDS WAS IT THEIR COLORS
1089-134691-0016 THEY WERE VOGING ACROSS THE DESERTS OF THE SKY A HOST OF NO MADS ON THE MARCH VOAGING HIGH OVER IRELAND WESTWARD BOUND
1089-134691-0017 THE EUROPE THEY HAD COME FROM LAY OUT THERE BEYOND THE IR SA EUROPE OF STRANGE TONGUES AND VALUEED AND WOULD BEGIRTED AND SET AIDILED AND OF ENTRENCHED AND MARSLLED RACES
1089-134691-0018 AGAIN AGAIN
1089-134691-0019 A VOICE FROM BEYOND THE WORLD WAS CALLING
1089-134691-0020 HELLO STEFF AN OEL' HERE COMES THE DBILLESS
1089-134691-0021 THEIR DIVING STONE POISED ON ITS RUDE SUPPORTS AND ROCKING UNDER THEIR PLUNGES AND THE ROUGHF HUM STONES OF THE SLOPING BRAK WATER OVER WHICH THEY SCRAMBLED IN THEIR HORSE PLAY GLEAMED WITH COLD WEFT LUSTRE
1089-134691-0022 HE STOOD STILL INDEFFERENCE TO THEIR CALLS AND PERRIEDD THEIR BANTER WITH EASY WORDS
1089-134691-0023 IT WAS A PAIN TO SEE THEM AND A SWORD LIKE PAIN TO SEE THE SCIGNS OF ADEOL ESCENCE THAT MADE REPELLENT THEIR PITYIABLE NAKEDNESS
1089-134691-0024 STEFFL ALL DEAD LOSS
1089-134691-0025 A MOMENT BEFORE THE GHOST OF THE ANCIENT KINGDOM OF THE DINES HAD LOOKED FORTH THROUGH THE VESTURE OF THEZERAPPED CITY
1188-133604-0000 YOU WILL FIND ME CONTINUALLY SPEAKING A FORE MEN TITION HOLD MIIN TURNER AND TIN CT AT IT ALMOST THE SAME TERMS
1188-133604-0001 THE UNIT EVERY QUALITY AND SOMETIMES YOU WILL FIND ME REFERINENT TO THEM AS COLORISTS SOMETIMES IS KEURE SCURISTS
1188-133604-0002 BY BEING STUDIOUS OF COLOR THEIR ARE STUDIOUS OF DIVISION AND WHILE THE CUREOSCURIST DEVOTES HIMSELF TO THE REPRESENTATION OF DEGREES OF FORCE IN ONE THING UNSEPARATED LIGHT THE COLORISTS HAVE FOR THEIR FUNCTION THE ATTAIN AND A BEAUTY BYRRANGEMENT OF THE DIVISIONS OF LIGHT
1188-133604-0003 MY FIRST PRINCIPAL REASON WAS THAT THEY ENFORCED BEYOND ALL RESISTANCE ON ANY STUDENT WHOM MIGHT ATTEMPT A COPY THEM THIS METHOD OF LAYING PORTIONS OF DISTINCT HUW SIDE BY SIDE
1188-133604-0004 SOME OF THE TOUCHES INDEED WHEN THE TINT HAS BEEN MIX'ED WITH MUCH WATER HAVE BEEN LAID IN LITTLE DROPS OR PONDS SO THAT THE PGMENT MIGHT CRISTELES HARD AT THE EDGE
1188-133604-0005 DOES THE HEAD OF APPAROT WITH A LITTLE FLOWUR IN HIS BEAK FROM A PICTURE OF CARPOATIUS ONE OF HIS SERIES OF THE LIFE OF SAINT GEORGE
1188-133604-0006 THEN HE COMES TO THE BEAK OF IT
1188-133604-0007 THE BROWN GROUND BENEATH IS LEFT FOR THE MOST PART ONE TOUCH A BLACK IS PUT FOR THE HOLLOW TO DELICATE LINES OF DARK GRAY FIND THE OUTER CURVE AND ONE LITTLE QUIVERING TOUCH OF WHITE DRAWS THE INNER EDGE OF THE MANDABLE
1188-133604-0008 FOR BELIEVE ME THE FINO PHILOSOPHY OF ART CAN ONLY RATIFY THEIR OPINION THAT THE BEAUTY OF A COCK ROBIN IS TO BE RED AND OF A GRASSP PLOT TO BE GREEN AND THE BESTKILLVART IS AN INSTANTLY SEIZING ON THE MANIFOLD DELICIOUSNESS OF LIGHT WHICH YOU CAN ONLY SEEES BY PRECISION OF INSTANTANEOUS TOUCH
1188-133604-0009 NA YOU WILL SEE IN THEE STUDIES AT THE MOMENT THE WHITE IS ENCLOSED PROPERLY AND HARMONIZED WITH THE OTHER HES IT BECOME SOMEHOW MORE PRECIOUS AND PEARLY THAN THE WHITE PAPER AND THAT I AM NOT AFRAID TO LEAVE A WHOLE FIELD OF UNTREATED WHITE PAPER ALL ROUND IT BEING SURE THAT EVEN THE LITTLE DIAMONDS AND THE ROUND WINDOW WILL TELL IS JEWELS IF THERE AGREDATED JUSTLY
1188-133604-0010 BUT IN THIS  VINE YET COPIED FROM TURNOR YOU HAVE THE TWO PRINCIPLES BROUGHT OUT PERFECTLY
1188-133604-0011 THEY ARE BEYOND ALL OTHER WORKS THAN I KNOW EXISTING DEPENDENT FOR THEIR EFFECT ON LOW SUBDUED TONES THEIR FAVOITE TOOIC IN TIME OF DVING EITHER DAWN OR TWILIGHT AND EVEN THERE BRIGHT A SUNSENS PRODUCED CHIEFLY OUT OF GRA PAPER
1188-133604-0012 IT MAY BE THAT A GREAT COLORLESS WILL USE HIS UTMOST FORCE OF COLOR AS A SINGER HIS FULL POWER OF VOICE BUT LOUD OR LOW THE VIRTUE IS IN BOTH CASES ALL WAS IN REFINEMENT NEVER IN ALLOWDNESS
1188-133604-0013 IT MUST REMEMBER BE ONE OR THE OTHER
1188-133604-0014 DO NOT THEREFORE THINK THAT THE GOTHIC SCHOOLS AN EASY ONE
1188-133604-0015 THE LAW OF THAT SCHOOLS THAT EVERYTHING SHALL BE SEEN CLEARLY AT LEAST ONLY IN SUCH MISTER FAINTNESS AS SHALL BE DELIGHTFUL AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE BEST INTRODUCTION TO IT WOULD BE THE ELEMENTARY PRACTICE OF PAINTING EVERY STUDY ON A GOLDEN GROUND
1188-133604-0016 THIS AT ONCE COMPELS YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE WORK IS TO BE IMAGINATIVE IN DECORATIVE THAT IT REPRESENTS BEAUTIFUL THINGS IN THE CLEAREST WAY BUT NOT UNDER EXISTING CONDITIONS AND THAT IN FACT YOUR PRODUCING JEWELLERS WORK RATHER THAN PEICTURES
1188-133604-0017 THAT A STYLES RESTRAINED OR SEVERE DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT IS ALSOERONEOUS
1188-133604-0018 IN ALL EARLY GOTHIC AART INDEED YOU WILL FIND FAILURE OF THIS KIND ESPECIAL DISTORTION AND RIGIDITY WHICH ARE IN MANY RESPECTS PAINFULLY TO BE COMPARED WITH THE SPLENDID REPOSE OF CLASSIC ART
1188-133604-0019 THE LARGE LETTER CONTAINS INDEED ENTIRELY FEEBLE ON ILL DRAWN FIGURES THAT IS MERELY CHILDLESS AND FAILING WORK OF AN INFEIR HAND IT IS NOT CHARACTERISTIC OFGOTHIC OR ANY OTHER SCHOOL
1188-133604-0020 BUT OBSERVE BE EVENIN ONLY DO THIS ON ONE CONDITION THAT OF STRIVING ALSO TO CREATE IN REALITY THE BEAUTY WHICH YOU SEEK IN IMAGINATION
1188-133604-0021 IT WILL BE WHOLL IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO RETAIN THE TRANQUILLITY OF TEMPER IN FELICITY OF FAITH NECESSARY FOR NOBLE PURES PAINTING UNLESSYEUR ACTIVELY ENGAZED IN PRORMOTING THE FELICITY AND PIEACE OF PRACTICAL LIFE
1188-133604-0022 YOU MUST LOOK AT HIM IN THE FACE FIGHT HIM CONQUER HIM WITH WHAT SCAVEE YOU MAY YOU NEED NOT THINK TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF HIM
1188-133604-0023 THE COLORIST SAYS FIRST OF ALL AS MY DELISHIOUS PARQETE WAS RUBY SO THIS NASTY VIIPA SHALLY BLACK AND THEN IS THE QUESTION CAN I ROUND HIM OFF EVEN THOUGH HE IS BLACK AND MAKE HIM SLIMY AND YET SPRINGING AND CLOSE DOWN CLOTTED LIKE A POOL OF BLACK BLOOD ON THE EARTH ALL THE SAME
1188-133604-0024 NOTHING WILL BE MORE PRECIOUS TO YOU I THINK IN THE PRACTICAL STUDY OF ART THAN THE CONVICTION WHICH WILL FORCE ITSELF ON YOU MORE MORE EVERY HOUR OF THE WAY ALL THINGS ARE BOUND TOGETHER LITTLE AND GREAT IN SPIRIT AND IN MATTER
1188-133604-0025 YOU KNOW I'VE JUST BEEN TELLING YOU HOW THE SCHOOL MATERIALISM INCLAY INVOLVED ITSELF AT LAST IN CLOUD AND FIRE
1188-133604-0026 HERE' IS AN EQUALLY TYPICAL GREEK SCHOOL LANDSCAPE BY WILSON LOST HOY AND GOLDEN MIST THE TREES SO SLIGHTLY DRAWN THAT YOU DON'T KNOW IF THEIR TREES WERE TOWERS AND NO CARE FOR COLOR WHATSOEVER PERFECTLY DECEPTED IN MARVELLLOUS EFFECT OF SUNSHINE THROUGH THE MIST A POLLO IN THE PIFON
1188-133604-0027 NOW HERE IS RAFHEL EXACTLY BETWEEN THE TWO TREES STILL DRAWN LEAIF BY LEAF HOLDY FORMAL BUT BEAUTIFUL MIST COM GRADUALLY INTO THE DISTANCE
1188-133604-0028 WHIL THEN LAST HERE IS TERURNS GREEK SCHOOL OF THE HIGHEST CLASS AND YOU TOFIN HIS ART ABSOLUTELY AS FIRST THE DISPLAYING INTENSELY AND WITH THE STERNST INTELLECT OF NATURAL FORM AS IT IS AND IN THE ENVELOPMENT OF IT WITH CLOUD AND FIRE
1188-133604-0029 ONLY THERE ARE TWO SOURCES OF CLOUD IN FIRE
1188-133604-0030 HE KNOWS HIM BATH
1188-133604-0031 THERE'S ONE IN TH THEREOSE ANOTHER THE DUDLY AND THE FLINT

1188-133604-0033 EVERY PLANT IN THE GRASSES SET FORMERLY GROWS PERFECTLY IT MAY BE REALIZED COMPLETELY
1188-133604-0034 EXQUISITE ORDER AND UNIVERSAL WITH ETERNAL LIFE IN LIGHT THIS IS THE FAITH AND EFFORT OF THE SCHOOLS OF CRSTEL AND YOU MADE DESCRIBE AND COMPLETE THEIR WORK QUITE LIALLY BY TAKING ANY VERSES OF CHSSER IN HIS TENDERMOD AN OBSERVING HOW HE INSISTS ON THE CLEARNESS IN BRIGHTNESS FIRST AND THEN ON THE ORDER
1188-133604-0035 THUS AND CHAANCE' DREAM
1188-133604-0036 IN BOTH THESE HIGH METHICAL SUBJECTS THE SURROUNDING NATURE THE SUFFERING IS STILL DIGNIFIED AND BEAUTIFUL
1188-133604-0037 EVERY LINE IN WHICH THE MASTER TRACES IT EVEN WERE SEEMINGLY NEGLGENT AS LOVELY AND SET DOWN WITH A MEDITATE OF CALMNESS WHICH MAKES THESE TWOO EDTCHINGSCAPABLE OF BEING PLACED BESIDE THE MOST TRANQUIL WORK OF WHOLE MIIND OR DURE
1188-133604-0038 BUT NOW HEREARS A SUBJECT OF WHICH YOU WILL WONDER AT FIRST WHYTERURNOR DREW IT AT ALL
1188-133604-0039 IT HAS NO BEAUTY WHATSOEVER NO SPECIALTY OF PICTURESQUENESS AND ALL ITS LINES ARE CRAMPED AND POOR
1188-133604-0040 THE CRAMNESS IN THE POVERTY OR ALL INTENDED
1188-133604-0041 IT IS A GLEANER BRINGING DOWN HER ONE SHEIEF OF CORN TO AN OLD WATER MILL ITSELF MASSY AND RENT SCARCELY ABLE TO GET IT STONES TO TURN
1188-133604-0042 THE SCENE IS ABSOLUTELY ARCADIAN
1188-133604-0043 SEE THAT YOUR LIS BEING NOTHING WORSE THAN A BOY'S CLIMING FOR HIS ENTANGLED KIGHT
1188-133604-0044 IT WILL BE WELL FOR YOU YOUJINED NOT WITH THOSE WHO INSTEAD OF KIGHTS FLY VAALKANS WHO INSTEAD OF OBEY THE LAST WORDS OF THE GREAT CLOUD SHEPHERD DEFEATED HIS SHEEP LIV THELIVES HOW MUCH LESS THAN VANITY OF THE WORLALF IN THE GARE EAGLE

1221-135766-0001 GOD AS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE SIN WHICH MAN THUS PUNISHED HAD GIVEN HER A LOVELY CHILD WHOSE PLACE WAS ON THAT SAME DISHONORED BOSOM TO CONNECT HER PARRENT FOREVER WITH THE RACE AND DESCENT OF MORTALS AND TO BE FINALLY A BLESS SOUL IN HEAVEN
1221-135766-0002 YET THESE THOUGHTS AFFECTEDSOR PRM LESS WITH HOPE THAN APPREHENSION
1221-135766-0003 THE CHILD HAD A NATIVE GRACE WHICH DOES NOT INVARRIABLY CO EXIST WITH FAULTLESS BEAUTY IT'S A TIRE HOWEVER SIMPLE ALWAYS IMPRESSED THE BEHOLDER AS IF IT WERE A VERY GARB THAT PRECISELY BECAME IT BEST
1221-135766-0004 THIS OUTWARD MUUTABILITY INDICATED AND DID NOT MORE THAN FAIRLY EXPRESSED THE VARIOUS PROPERTIES OF HER INN HER LIFE
1221-135766-0005 HESTHER COULD ONLY ACCOUNT FOR THE CHILD'S CHARACTER AND EVEN THEN MOST VAGUELY AND IMPERFECTLY BY RECALLING WHICH SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN DURING THAT MOMENTOUS PERIOD WHILE PEARL WASMBIBING HER SOUL FROM THE SPIRITUAL WORLD AND HER BODILY FREME BRM ITS MATERIAL OF EARTH
1221-135766-0006 THEY WERE NOW ILLUMINATED BY THE MORNING RADIANCE OF A YOUNG CHILD'S DISPOSITION BUT LATER IN THE DAY OF EARTHLY EXISTENCE MIGHT BE PRELIFIC OF THE STORM AND WHIRLWIND
1221-135766-0007 HESTER PRIN NEVERTHELESS THE LOVING MOTHER OF THIS ONE CHILD RAN LITTLE RISK OF AIRRING ON THE SIDE OF UNDUE SEVERITY
1221-135766-0008 MINDFUL HOWEVER OF HER OWN ERRORS AND MISFORTUNES SHE EARLY SOUGHT TO IMPOSE A TENDER BUT STRICT CONTROL OVER THE INFANT IMMORTALITY THAT WAS COMMITTED TO HER CHARGE
1221-135766-0009 AS TO ANY OTHER KIND OF DISCIPLINE WHETHER ADDRESSED TO HER MIND OR HEART LITTLE PEARL MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE WITHIN ITS REACH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CAPRIECE THAT RLLED THE MOMENT
1221-135766-0010 IT WAS A LOOK SO INTELLIGENTET ITXPLICABLE PERVERSE SOMETIMES SO MALICIOUS BUT GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED BY A WILD FLOW OF SPIRITS THAT HESOR COULD NOTL QUESTIONING OF SUCH MOMENTS WITHTHER PEARL WAS A HUMAN CHILD
1221-135766-0011 BEHOLDING IT ESTHER WAS CONSTRAINED TO RUSH TOWARDS THE CHILD TO PURSUE THE LITTLE EALTH IN THE FLIGHT WHICH SHE INVARRIABLY BEGAN TO SNATCH HER TO HER BOSOM WITH A CLOSE PRESSURE AND EARNEST KISSES NOT SO MUCH FROM OVERFLOWING LOVE AS TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT PEARL WAS FLESHEN BLOOD AND NOT UTTERLY DELUCIVE
1221-135766-0012 BROODING OVER ALL THESE MATTERS THE MOTHER FELT LIKE ONE WHO HAS A VOKE ASIRIT BUT BY SOME IRREGULARITY IN THE PROCESS OF CONJURATION HAS FAILED TO WIN THE MASTER WORD THAT SHOULD CONTROL THIS NEW AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE INTELLIGENCE
1221-135766-0013 PEARL WAS A BORNE OUTCAST OF THE INFANTALE WORLD
1221-135766-0014 PRL SAW E GAZED INTENTLY BUT NEVER SOUGHT TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE
1221-135766-0015 IF SPOKEN TO SHE WOULD NOT SPEAK AGAIN
1221-135767-0000 HESTHER PRIN WENT ONE DAY TO THE MANSION OF GOVERNOR BELLING HIM WITH A PAIR OF GLOVES WHICH SHE HAD FRED AND EMBROIDERED TO HIS ORDER AND WHICH WERE TO BE WORN ON SOME GREAT OCCASION OF STATE BORE THOUGH THE CHANCES OF A POPULAR ELECTION HAD CAUSED THE SPIRMER RULER TO DESCEND A STEP OR TWO FROM THE HIGHEST RAANK HE STILL HELD AN HONORABLE AN INFLUENTIAL PLACE AMONG THE COLONIAL MAGISTRCY
1221-135767-0001 ANOTHER AND FAR MORE IMPORTANT REASON THAN THE DELIVERY OF A PAIR OF EMBROIDERED GLOVES IMPELLED HESRE AT THIS TIME TO SEEK AN INTERVIEW WITH A PERSONAGE OF SO MUCH POWER AND ACTIVITY IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE SETTLEMENT
1221-135767-0002 AT THAT EPOCH OF PSTINE SIMPLICITY HOWEVER MATTERS OF EVEN SLIGHTTER PUBLIC INTEREST AND OF FAR LESS IN TRINSIC WEATE THAN THE WELFARE OF HESOR ANDTER CHILD WERE STRANGELY MIXED UP WITH THE DELIBERATIONS OF LEGISLATORS AND ACTS OF STATE
1221-135767-0003 THE PERIOD WAS HARDLY IF AT ALL EARLIER THAN THAT OF OUR STORY WHEN A DISPUTE CONCERNING THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY IN A PIG NOT ONLY CAUSE A FIERCE AND BITTER CONTEST IN THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OF THE COLONY BUT RESULTED IN AN IMPORTANT MODIFICATION OF THE FRAME WORK ITSELF OF THE LEGISLATURE
1221-135767-0004 WE HAVE SPOKEN OF PEARLS RICH AND LUXURIANT BEAUTY A BEAUTY THAT SHONE WITH DEEP AND VIVID TINTS A BRIGHT COMPLEXION EYES POSSESSING INTENSITY BOTH OF DEPTH AND GLOW AND HARE ALREADY OF A DEEP GLOSSY BROWN AND WHICH IN AFTER YEARS WOULD BE NEARLY AKIN TO BLACK
1221-135767-0005 IT WAS THE SCARLET LETTER IN ANOTHER FORM THE SCARLET LETTER ENDOWED WITH LIFE
1221-135767-0006 THE MOTHER HERSELF AS IF THE RED IGNOMINA WERE SO DEEPLY SCORCHED INTO HER BRAIN THAT ALL HER CONCEPTIONS ASSUMED ITS FORM HAD CAREFULLY WROUGHT OUT THE SIMILITUDE LAVISHING MANY HOURS OF MOR BID INGENUITY TO CREATE AN ANALGY BETWEEN THE OBJECT OF HER AFFECTION AND THE EMBLEM OF HER GUILT AND TORTURE
1221-135767-0007 BUT IN TRUTH PEARL WAS THE ONE AS WELL AS THE OTHER AND ONLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IDENTITY HAD HES HER CONTRIVE SO PERFECTLY TO REPRESENT THE SCARLET LETTER IN HER APPEARANCE
1221-135767-0008 COME THEREFORE AND LET US FLING MUT AT THEM
1221-135767-0009 BUT PEARL WHO WAS ADAUNTLESS CHILD AFTER FROWNING STAMPING HER FOOT AND SHAKING HER LITTLE HAND WITH A VARIETY OF THREATENING GESTURES SUDDENLY MADE A RUSH AT THE K NOT OF HER ENEMIES AND PUT THEM ALL TO FLIGHT
1221-135767-0010 SHE SCREAMED AND SHOUTED TOO WITH A TERRIFIC VOLUME OF SOUND WHICH DOUBTLESS CAUSEED THE HEARTS OF THE FUGITIVES TO QUAKE WITHIN THEM
1221-135767-0011 IT WAS FURTHER DECORATED WITH STRANGE AND SEEMINGLY CABALISTIC FIGURES AND DIAGRAMS SUITIBLE TO THE QUIN TASTE OF THE AGE WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN IN THE STCHCO WHEN NEWLY LAYID ON AND HAD NOW GROWN HARD ANDDORABLE FOR THE ADMIRATION OF AFTER TIMES
1221-135767-0012 THEY APPROACHED THE DOOR WHICH WAS OF AN ARCHED FORM AND FLANKED ON EACH SIDE BY A NARROW TOWER OR PROJECTTION OF THE EDIFICE IN BOTH OF WHICH WERE LATDICE WINDOWS THE WOODEN SHUTTERSOOK CLOSE OVER THEM AT NEED
1221-135767-0013 LIFTING THE IRON HAMMUR THAT HUNG IT THE PORALS TO PRM GAVE A SUMMONS WHICH WAS ANSWERED BY ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BONSERVANTS A FREE BORN ENGLISH MAN BUT NOW A SEVEN YEARS SLAVE
1221-135767-0014 YEA HIS HONOORABLE WORSHIP ISMTHIN BUT HE HATH A GODLY MINISTER OR TWO WITH HIM AND LIKEWISE E ALLACH
1221-135767-0015 YOU MAY NOT SEE HIS WORSHIP NOW
1221-135767-0016 WITH MANY VARIATIONS SUGGESTED BY THE NATURE OF HIS BUILDING MATERIALS DIVERSITY OF CLIMATE AND HE DIFFERENT MODE OF SOCIAL LIFE GOVERNOR BELLING HIM HAD PLANNED HIS NEW HABITATION AFTER THE RESIDENCES OF GENTLEMEN OF FAIRST STATE IN HIS NATIVE LAND
1221-135767-0017 ON THE TABLE AND TOKEN THAT THE SENTIMENT OF OLD ENGLISH HOSPITALITY HAD NOT BEEN LEFT BEHIND STOOD A LARGE PEUTER TANKERD AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH HAD HASTER OR PEARL PEEPED INTO IT THEY MIGHT HAVE SEEN THE FROTHY REMNANT OF A RECENT DRAGHT OF ALE
1221-135767-0018 LITTLE PEARL WHO WAS AS GREATLY PLEASED WITH THE GLEAMOMING ARMOUR AS SHE HAD BEEN WITH THE GLITTERING FRONTAS PIECE OF THE HOUSE SPENT SOME TIME LOOKING INTO THE POLISHED MIRROR OF THE BREAST PLATE
1221-135767-0019 MOTHER CRIED SHE I SEE YOU HERE LOOK LOOK
1221-135767-0020 AND TRUTH SHE SEEMED ABSOLUTELY HIDDEN BEHIND IT
1221-135767-0021 PEARL ACCORDINGLY RAN TO THE BOW WINDOW AT THE FURTHER END OF THE HALL AND LOOKED ALONG THE VISTA OF A GARDEN WALK CARPETED WITH CLOSELY SHAVEN GRASS AND BORDERED WITH SOME RUDE AND IMMATOR ATTEMPT A SHRUBBERY
1221-135767-0022 BUT THE PROPRIETOR APPEARED ALREADY TO HAVE LIINQUISHED AS HOPELESS THE EFFORT TO PERPETUATE ON THIS SIDEIGHT OF THE ATLANTIC IN A HARD SOIL AND AMID THE CLOSE STRUGGLE FOR SUBSISTENCE THE NATIVE ENGLISH TASTE FOR ORNAMENTAL GARDENING
1221-135767-0023 THERE WERE A FEW ROSE BUSHES HOWEVER AND NUMBER OF APPLE TREES PROBABLY THE DESCENDANTANCE OF THOSE PLANTED BY THE REVERD MISTER BLACKSTONE THE FIRST SETTLER OF THE PININSULA THAT HALF MITHOLOGICAL PERSONAGE WHO RIDES THROUGH OUR EARLY ANALS SEATED ON THE BACK OF THE BULL
1221-135767-0024 PEARL SEEING THE ROSE BUSHES BEGAN TO CRY FOR A RED ROS AND WOULD NOT BE PASSIFIED
1284-1180-0000 HE WORE BLUE SILK STOCKINGS BLOONYANS WITH GOLD BUCKLES A BLUE RUFFLED WAISTE AND A JACKET OF BRIGHT BLUE BRAIGHTED WITH GOLD
1284-1180-0001 HIS HAT HAD A PEAKED CROWN IN THE FLAT BRIM AND AROUND THE BRIM WAS A ROW OF TINY GOLDEN BELLS THAT TINKLED WHEN HE MOVED
1284-1180-0002 INSTEAD OF SHOES THE OLD MAN WOR BOOTS WITH TURN OVER TOPS AND AS BLUE COAT HAD WIDE CUFS OF GOLD BRAID
1284-1180-0003 FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD WISHED TO EXPLORE THE BEAUTIFULLAND OF AWESE IN WHICH THEY LIVED
1284-1180-0004 WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE UN SIMPLY LATCHED THE DOOR AND STARTED UP THE PATH
1284-1180-0005 NO ONE WOULD DISTURB THEIR LITTLE HOUSE EVEN IF ANY ONE CAME SO FAR INTO THE THICK FOREST WHILE THEY WERE GONE
1284-1180-0006 AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN SEPARATED THE COUNTRY OF THE MUNCHKINS FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE GILICANS THE PATH DIVIDED
1284-1180-0007 HE KNEW IT WOULD TAKE THEM TO THE HOUSE OF THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN BUT WHO WAS THEIR NEAREST NEIGHBOUR
1284-1180-0008 ALL THE MORNING THEY TRUDGED UP THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND IT NOON UNCAN OJO SAT ON A FALLEN TREE TRUNK AND AT THE LAST OF THE BREAD WHICH THE OLDLUNCHIN HAD PLACED IN HIS POCKET
1284-1180-0009 THEN THEY STARTED ON AGAIN AND TWO HOURS LATER CAME IN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE OF DOCTOR PIPPT
1284-1180-0010 OCNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE AND A CHUBBY PLEASANT FACED WOMAN DRESSED ALLM BLUE OPENED IT AND CRREADED THE VISITORS WITH A SMILE
1284-1180-0011 I AM MY DEAR AND ALL STRANGERS ARE WELCOME TO MY HOME
1284-1180-0012 WE HAVE COME FROM A FIRE LONELY A PLACE THAN THIS A LONELIER PLACE
1284-1180-0013 AND YOU MUST BE  OJOV THEI UNLUCKY SHE ADDED
1284-1180-0014 OHDIO HAD NEVER EATEN SUCH A FINE MEAL AND ALL HIS LIFE
1284-1180-0015 WE TRAVELLING REPLIED OJOH AND WE STOPP AT YOURALTH JUST A RESTED IN REFRESH OURSELVES
1284-1180-0016 THE WOMAN SEEMED THOUGHTFUL
1284-1180-0017 AT ONE THE END STOOD A GREAT FIREPLACE IN WHICH A BLUE LOG WAS BLAZING WITH A BLUE FLAME AND OVER THE FIRE HUNG F KETTLES IN A ROW OLD BUBBLING AND STEAMING AT A GREAT RATE
1284-1180-0018 IT TAKES ME SEVERALE YEARS TO MAKE THIS MAGIC POWDER BUT AT THIS MOMENT I AM PLEASED TO SAY IT IS NEARLY DONE YOU SEE I AM MAKING IT FOR MY GOOD WIFE MARGALLT WHOANTS TO SOME OF IT FOR A PURPOSE OF HER OWN
1284-1180-0019 YOU MUST KNOW SAID MARGALLD WHEN THEY WERE ALL SEATED TOGETHER ON THE BROAD WINDOW SEAT THEN MY HUSBAND FOOLISHLY GAVE AWAY ALL THE POWDER OF LIFE HE FIRST MADE TO OLD MAMBY THE WITCH WHO USED TO LEAVE IN THE COUNTRY OF THE GLLICANS TO THE NORTHTH HERE
1284-1180-0020 THE FIRST LOT WE TESTED ON OUR GLASS HAT WHICH NOT ONLY BEGAN TO LIVE BUT HAS LIVED EVER SINCE
1284-1180-0021 I THINK THE NEXT GLASS CAB THE MAGICIAN MAKES WILL HAVE NEITHER BRAINS NOR HEART FOR THEN IT WILL NOT OBJECT TO CATCHING MICE AND THEY PROVE OF SOME USE TO US
1284-1180-0022 I'M AFRAID I DON'T KNOW MUCH YOU ABOUT THE LAND OFES
1284-1180-0023 YOU SEE I'VE LIVED ALL MY LIFE WITHUT MONKEY AILENT ONE AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO TELL ME ANYTHING
1284-1180-0024 THAT IS ONE REASON YOU ARE JO THE UNLUCKY SAID THE WOMAN IN SYMPATHETIC TONE
1284-1180-0025 I THINK I MUST SHOW YOU MY PATCHWOR GIRL SAID MARGALLA LAUGHING AT THE BOY'S ASTONISHMENT FOR SHE IS RATHER DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN
1284-1180-0026 BUT FIRST I WILL TELL YOU THAT FROM MANY YEARS I HAVE LONGED FOR A SERVANT TO HELP ME WITH AALF HOUSEWORK AND TO COKE THE MEALS AND WASH THE DISHES
1284-1180-0027 YET THAT TASK WAS NOT SO EASY AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE
1284-1180-0028 A BED QUILT MADE OF PATCHES OF DIFFERENT KINDS AND COLLARS OF CLOTH ONLYATLY SO TOGETHER
1284-1180-0029 SOMETIMES IT IS CALLED A CRAZY QUIILT BECAUSE THE PATCHES AND COLOURS ARE SO MIXED UP
1284-1180-0030 WHEN I FOUND DID I SAID TO MYSELF THAT IT WOULD DO NICELY FROM MY SERVANT GIRL FOR WHEN SHE WAS BROUGHT TO LIFE SHE WOULD NOT BE PROUD NOR HAUGHTY AS THE GLASS CAT IS FOR SUCH A DREADFUL MIXTURE OF COLORS WOULD DISCOURED HER FROM TIME TO BE AS DIGNIFIED AS THE BLUE MUNCH GKINEN'S ARE
1284-1180-0031 AT THE EMERALD CITY WHERE OUR PRINCESSS MALIVES GREEN IS THE POPULAR COLOR
1284-1180-0032 I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT A GOOD JOAW I DID AND SHE WENT TO IT TALL CUPBOARD AND THREW OPEN THE DOORS
1284-1181-0000 O J EXAMINED THIS CURIOUS CONTRIVANTANCE WITH WONDER
1284-1181-0001 MARGALAD HAD FIRST MADE THE GIRLS FORMED FROM THE PATCHWOR QUIILED AND THEN SHE HADDRESSED IT WITH A PATCHWORK SKIRT AND AN APRON WITH POCKETS IN IT USING THE SAME GYE MATERIAL THROUGH OUT
1284-1181-0002 THE HEAD OF THE PATWAR GIRL WAS THE MOST CURIOUS PART OF HER
1284-1181-0003 THE HAIR WAS OF BROWN YARN AND HUNG DOWN ON HER NECK IN SEVERAL NEAT BRAINS
1284-1181-0004 GOLD IS THE MOST COMMON METLE IN THE LAND OF AWS AND IS USED FROM MANY PURPOSES BECAUSE IT IS SOFT IMPLIABLE
1284-1181-0005 NO I' FORGOT ONEN ABOUT TO BRAINS EXCLAIMED THE WOMAN
1284-1181-0006 WELL THAT MAY BE TRUE AGREED MARGALA BUT ON THE CONTRARY A SERVANT WITH TOO MUCH BRAINS IS SURE TO BECOME INDEPENDENT IN HIGH AND MIGHTY AND FEEL ABOVE HER WORK
1284-1181-0007 SHE POURED INTO THE DISH A QUANTITY FROM EACH OF THESE BOTTLES
1284-1181-0008 I THINK THAT WILL DO SHE CONTINUED FOR THE OTHER QUALITIES ARE NOT NEEDED IN A SERVANT
1284-1181-0009 SHE RAN TO HER HUSBAND SIDE AT ONCE AND HELPED HIM LIFT THE FOUR CATTELS FROM THE FIRE
1284-1181-0010 THEIR CONTENTS HAD WHOLE BOILED AWAY LEAVING IN THE BOTTOM OF EACH KTTLE A FEW GRAINS OF FINE WHITE POWDER
1284-1181-0011 VERY CAREFULLY THE MAGICIAN REMOVED THIS POWDER PLACING IT ALTOGETHER IN A GOLDEN DISH WHERE HE MIXED IT WITH A GOLDEN SPOON
1284-1181-0012 NO ONE SAW HIM DO THIS FOR ALL WERE LOOKING AT THE POWDER OF LIFE BUT SOON THE WOMAN REMEMBERED WHAT SHE HAD BEEN DOING AND CAME BACK TO THE CUBOARD
1284-1181-0013 O JOOBECAME A BIT UNEASY AT THIS FOR HE HAD ALREADY PUT QUITE A LOT OF THE CLEVERNESS POWDER IN THE DISH BUT HE DARED NOT INTERFERE AND SO HE COMFORTED HIMSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT ONE CANO NOT HAVE TOO MUCH CLEVERNESS
1284-1181-0014 HE SELECTED A SMALL GOLD BOTTLE WITH A PEPPER BOX TOP SO THAT THE POWDER MIGHT BE SPRINKLED ON ANY OBJECT THROUGH THE SMALL HOLES
1284-1181-0015 MOST PEOPLE TALKED TOO MUCH SO IT IS A RELIEF TO FIND ONE WHO TALKS TOO LITTLE
1284-1181-0016 I AM NOT A ALLUD OF BEFORE MAGIC EXCEPT FOR MY OWN AMUSEMENT HE TOLD HIS VISITORS AS HE LIGHTED A PIPE WITH A CROOOKEN STEM AND BEGAN TO SMOKE
1284-1181-0017 THE WS IT OF ASE WHO USED TO BE A HUMBAGAN KNEW NO MAGIC AT ALL HAS BEEN TAKEING LESSONS OF GLENDA AND I'MTLD HE IS GETTING TO BE A PRETTY GOOD WIZARD BUT HE IS MERELY THE ASSISTANT OF THE GREAT SOURCEERS
1284-1181-0018 IT TRULY IS ASST OF THE MAGICIAN
1284-1181-0019 I NOW USE THEM AS ORNAMENTAL STATUARY IN MY GARDEN
1284-1181-0020 DEAR ME WHAT A CHATTER BOX ARE GETTING TO BE UNK REMARKED THEM MAGICI WHO WAS PLEASED WITH THE COMPLIMENT
1284-1181-0021 ASKED THE VOICE IN SCORNFULIL ACCENTS
1284-134647-0000 THE GREATEFUL APPLAUSE OF THE CLERGY HAS CONSECRATED THE MEMORY OF A PRINCE WHO INDULED THEIR PASSIONS AND PROMOTED THEIR INTEREST
1284-134647-0001 THE EDOIC OF MILAND THE GREAT CHARTER OF TOLERATION HAD CONFIRMED TO EACH INDIVIDUAL OF THE ROMAN WORLD THE PRIVILEGE OF CHOOSING AND PROFESSING HIS OWN RELIGION
1284-134647-0002 BUT THIS INNEESTIMABLE PRIVILEGE WAS SOON VIOLATED WITH A KNOWLEDGE OF TRUTH THE EMPEROR E BABED THE MAXIMS OF PERSECUTION AND THE SECTX WHICH DESCENTED FROM THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WERE EFFLICTED AND OPPRESSED BY THE TRIUMPH OF CHRISTIANITY
1284-134647-0003 CONSTANTINE EASILY BELIEVED THAT THE HERITICS WHO PRESUMED TO DISPUTE HIS OPINIONS OR TO OPPOSE HIS COMMANDS WERE GUILTY OF THE MOST ABSURD AND CRIMINAL OBSTINACY AND THAT A SEASONABLE APPLICATION OF MODERUS SEVERITIES MIGHT SAVE THOSE UNHAPPY MEN FROM THE DANGER OF AN EVERLAST INCONDEMINATION
1284-134647-0004 SOME OF THE PENAL REGULATIONS WERE COPIED FROM THE EDICS OF DIOCLATION AND THIS METHOD OF CONVERSION WAS APPLATED BY THE SAME BISHOPS WHO HAD FELT THE HAND OF OPPRESSION AND PLEADED FOR THE RIGHTS OF HUMANITY
1284-134647-0005 THEY ASSERTED WITH CONFIDENCE AND ALMOST EXALTATION THAT THE OPPOSTOLICAL SUCCESSION WAS INTERRUPTED THAT ALL THE BISHOPS OF EUROPE AND ASIA WERE INFFECTED BY THE KTAGION OF GUILT IN SKISM AND THAT THE PROGATIVES OF THE CTHFOLIC CHURCH WERE CONFINED TO THE CHOSEN PORTION OF THE AFRICAN BELIEVERS WHO ALONE HAD PRESERVED IN VIOLET THE INTEGRITY OF THEIR FAITH AND DISCIPLINE
1284-134647-0006 BISHOPS VIRGINS AND EVEN SPOTLESS INFANTS WERE SUBJECTED TO THE DISGRACE OF A PUBLIC PENENCE BEFORE THEY COULD BE ADMITTED TO THE COMMUNION OF THE DONATISTS
1284-134647-0007 PRESCRIBEDE BY THE CIVIL AND ECLESIASTICAL POWERS OF THE EMPIRE THE DONTIST STILL MAINTAINED IN SOME PROVINCES PARTICULARLY IN AMIDA THEIR SUPERIOR NUMBERS AND FOUR HUNDRED BISHOPS ACKNOWLEDGE THE JURISDICTION OF THEIR PRIMATE
1320-122612-0000 SINCE THE PERIOD OF OUR TAIL THE ACT OF SPIRIT OF THE COUNTRY HAS SURROUNDED IT WITH A BELT OF RICH AND THRIVING SETTLEMENTS THOUGH NONE BUT THE HUNTER OR THE SAVAGES EVER KNOWN EVEN NOW TO PENETRT ITS WILD RECESSES
1320-122612-0001 THE DEEWS WERE SUFFERED TO EXAL AND THE SUN HAD DISPERSED THE MISTS AND WAS SHTTING AS STRONG AND CLEAR LIGHT IN THE FOREST WHEN THE TRAVELLERS RESUMED THEIR JOURNEY
1320-122612-0002 AFTER PROCEEDING A FEW MILES THE PROGRESS OF HAKAYE WHO LED THE ADVANCE BECAME MORE DELIBERATE AND WATCHFUL
1320-122612-0003 HE OFTEN STOPPED TO EXAMINE THE TREES NOR DID HE CROSS A RIVULATE WITHOUT ATTENTIVELY CONSIDERING THE QUANTITY THE VELOCITY AND THE COLOR OF ITS WATERS
1320-122612-0004 DISTRUSTING HIS OWN JUDGMENT HA HIS APPEALS TO THE OPINION OF CHINGKETCHKOOK WERE FREQUENT AND EARNEST
1320-122612-0005 YET HERE WE WITHIN A SHORT RANGE OF THE SCOONS AND NOT A SIGN OF A TRAIL HAVE WE CRROSSED
1320-122612-0006 LET US RETRACE OUR STEPS AND EXAMINE AS WE GO WITH KEEN OR EYES
1320-122612-0007 CHINGETCHKOOK HAD CAUGHT THE LOOK AND MOTIONING WITH HIS HAND HE BADE HIM SPEAK
1320-122612-0008 THE EYES OF THE WHOLE PARTY FOLLOWED THE UNEXPECTED MOVEMENT AND READ THEIR SUCCESS IN THE AIR OF TRIUMPH THAT THE YOUTH ASSUMED
1320-122612-0009 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE WONDERFUL HAD HEY SPOKEN WITHOUT A BIDDING
1320-122612-0010 SEE SAID UNCASS POINTING NORTH AND SOUTH AT THE EVIDENT MARKS OF THE BROAD TRAIL ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM THE DARK HAIR HAS GONE TOWARD THE FOREST
1320-122612-0011 IF A ROCK OR RIVLE IT OR BIT OF EARTH HARDER THAN COMMON SEVERED THE LINKS OF THE CLEW THEY FOLLOWED THE TRUE EYE OF THE SCOUT RECOVERED THEM AT A DISTANCE AND SELDOM RENDERED THE DELAY OF A SINGLE MOMENT NECESSARY
1320-122612-0012 EXTINGUISHED BRANS WERE LYING AROUND A SPRING THE AWFULS OF A DEAR WERE SCATTERED ABOUT THE PLACE AND THE TREESRE EVIDENT MARKS OF HAVING BEEN BROWSED BY THE HORSES
1320-122612-0013 ACIRCLE OF A FEW HUNDRED FEET IN CIRCUMFERENCE WAS DRAWN AND EACH OF THE PARTY TOOK ASEGNMENT FOR HIS PORTION
1320-122612-0014 THE EXAMINATION HOWEVER RESULTED IN NO DISCOVERY
1320-122612-0015 THE WHOLE PARTY CROWDED TO THE SPOT WERE UNCAS POINTED OUT THE IMPRESSION OF A MOCCASIN IN THE MOISTLOUVION
1320-122612-0016 RUN BACK UNCUS AND BRING ME THE SIZE OF THE SING'ERS FOOT
1320-122617-0000 NOTWITHSTANDING THE HIGH RESOLUTION OF HAWKAYE HE FULLY COMPREHENDED ALL THE DIFFICULTIES AND DANGER HE WAS ABOUT TO INCUR
1320-122617-0001 IN HIS RETURN TO THE CAMP HIS ACCUTE HIM PRACTISED INTELLECTS WERE INTENTLY ENGAGED IN DEVISING MEANS TO COUNTERACT A WATCHFULNESS AND SUSPICION ON THE PART OF HIS ENEMIES THAT HE KNEW WERE IN NO DEGREE INFERIOR TO HIS OWN
1320-122617-0002 IN OTHER WORDS WHILE HE HAD IMPLICIT FAITH IN THE ABILITY OF BAILAMS ASKED TO SPEAK HE WAS SOHAT SKPTICLE ON THE SUBJECT OF A BARE SINGING AND YET HE HAD BEEN ASSURED OF THE LATTER ON THE TESTIMONY OF HIS OWN EXQUISITE ORGANS
1320-122617-0003 THERE WERE SOMETHING IN HIS AIR IN THE MANNER THAT BETRAYED TO THE SCOUT THE UTTER CONFUSION OF THE STATE OF HIS MIND
1320-122617-0004 THE INGENIOUS HACKAYE WHO RECALLED THE HASTY MANNER IN WHICH THE OTHER HAD ABANDON HIS POST AT THE BEDSIDE OF THE SICK WOMAN WAS NOT WITHOUT HIS SUSPICIONS CONCERNING THE SUBJECT OF SO MUCH SOLEMN DELIBERATION
1320-122617-0005 THE BARE SHOOK HIS SHAGGY SIDES AND THEN A WELL KNOWN VOICE REPLIED
1320-122617-0006 CAN THESE THINGS BE RETURNED DAVID BREATHING MORE FREELY AS THE TRUTH BEGAN TO DAWNE UPON HIM
1320-122617-0007 COME COME RETURNED HAWKAYE UNCASING HIS HONEST COUNTENANCE THE BETTER TO ASSURE THE WAVERING CONFIDENCE OF HIS COMPANION YOU MAY SEE A SKIN WHICH IF IT BE NOT AS WHITE IS ONE OF THE GENTLE ONES HAS NO TINGE OF RED TO IT THAT THE WINDS OF THE HEAVEN IN THE SON HAVE NOT BESTOWED NOW LET US TO BUSINESS
1320-122617-0008 THE YOUNG MAN AS EBNDAGE AND MUCH I FEAR HIS DEATH HA IS DECEED
1320-122617-0009 I GREATLY MOURNED THAT ONE SO WELL DISPOSED SHOULD DIE IN HIS IGNORANCE AND I HAVE SOUGHT A GOODLY HIM CAN YOU LEAD ME TO HIM
1320-122617-0010 THE TASK WILL NOT BE DIFFICULT RETURN DAVID HESITATING THOUGH I GREATLY FERIOR PRESENCE WOULD RATHER INCREASE THAT MITIGATE HIS UNHAPPY FORTUNES
1320-122617-0011 THE LOGE IN WHICH OCUS WAS CONFINED WAS IN THE VERY CENTRE OF THE VILLAGE AND IN A SITUATION PERHAPS MORE DIFFICULT THAN ANY OTHER TO APPROACH OR LEAVE WITHOUT OBSERVATION
1320-122617-0012 FOR A FIVE OF THE LATTER ONLY LINGERED ABOUT THE DOOR OF THE PRISON OF UNCUS WEARY BUT CLOSE OBSERVERS OF THE MANNER OF THEIR CAPTIVE
1320-122617-0013 DELIVERED IN A STRONG TONE OF ASCENT ANNOUNCED THE GRATIFICATION THE SAVAGE WOULD RECEIVE IN WITNESSING SUCH AN EXHIBITION OF WEAKNESS AND AN ENEMY SO LONG HATED AND SO MUCH FEARED
1320-122617-0014 THEY DREW BACK A LITTLE FROM THE ENTRANCE AND MOTIONED TO THE SUPPOSED IT CONJURER TO ENTER
1320-122617-0015 BUT THE BARE INSTEAD OFFUL BAYING MAINTAIN OF THE SEATED HAD TAKEN AND GROWLED
1320-122617-0016 THE CUNNING MAN IS AFRAID THAT HIS BREATH WILL BLOW UPON HIS BROTHERS AND TAKE AWAY THEIR COURAGE TOO CONTINUED DAVID IMPROVING THE HINT HE RECEIVED THEY MUST STAND FURTHER OFF
1320-122617-0017 THEN AS IF SATISFIED OF THEIR SAFETY THE SCOUT LEFT HIS POSITION AND SLOWLY ENTERED THE PLACE
1320-122617-0018 IT WAS SILENT AND GLOOMY BEING TENENTED SOLELY BY THE CAPTIVE ANDLIGHTED BY THE DYING EMBERS OF A FIRE WHICH HAD BEEN USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF COOOKERY
1320-122617-0019 UNCAS OCCUPIED A DISTANT CORNER IN A RECLINING ATTITUDE BEING RIGIDLY BOUND BOTH HANDS AND FEET BY STRONG AND PAINFUL WITH
1320-122617-0020 THE SCOUT WHO HAD LEFT DAVID AT THE DOOR TO ASCERTAIN THEY WERE NOT OBSERVED THOUGHT IT PRUDENT TO PRESERVE HIS DISGUISE UNTIL ASSURED OF THEIR PRIVACY
1320-122617-0021 WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH THE MINGOS AT THE DOOR THEY COUNT SIX AND THE SINGERS AS GOOD AS NOTHING
1320-122617-0022 THE DELAWARES ARE CHILDREN OF THE TORTESES AND OUTSTRIPP THE DEER
1320-122617-0023 UNCAS WHO HAD ALREAD APPROACHED THE DOOR IN READINESS TO LEAD THE WAY NOW RECOILED AND PLACED HIMSELF ONCE MORE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE LODGE
1320-122617-0024 BUT HACKYE WHO WAS TOO MUCH OCCUPIED WITH HIS OWN THOUGHTS TO NOT OUTE THE MOVEMENT CONTINUED SPEAKING MORE TO HIMSELF INTO HIS COMPANION
1320-122617-0025 SO UNCUS YOU HAD BETTER TAKE TO LEAD WHILE I WILL PUT ON THE SKIIN AGAIN IN TRUST TO CUNNING FORANT OF SPEED
1320-122617-0026 WELL WHAT CAN'T BE DONE BY MAIN COURAGE IN WAR MUST BE DONE BY CIRCUMVENTION
1320-122617-0027 AS SOON AS THESE DISPOSITIONS WERE MADE THE SCOUT TURN TO DAVID AND GAVE HIM HIS PARTING INSTRUCTIONS

1320-122617-0032 KEEP SILENT AS LONG AS MAY BE AND IT WOULD BE WISE WHEN YOU DO SPEAK TO BREAK OUT SUDDENLY IN ONE OF YOUR SHOUTINGS WHICH WILL SERVE TO REMIND THE INDIANS THAT YOU ARE NOT ALTOGETHER AS RESPONSIBLE AS MEN SHOULD BE
1320-122617-0033 IF HOWEVER THEY TAKE YOUR SCALP AS I TRUST IN BELIEVE THEY WILL NOT DEPEND ON IT UNCAS AND I WILL NOT FORGET THE DEED BUT REVENGE IT IS BECOMES TRUE WARRIORS IN TRUSTY FRIENDS

1320-122617-0040 HE HAD NO OCCASION TO DELAY FOR AT THE NEXT INSTANT A BURST OF CRIES FILLED THE OUTER AIR AND RAN ALONG THE WHOLE EXTENT OF THE VILLAGE
1320-122617-0041 UNCAS CAST HIS SKIN AND STEPPED FORTH IN HIS OWN BEAUTIFUL PROPORTIONS
1580-141083-0000 I WILL ENDEAVOUR IN MY STATEMENT TO AVOID SUCH TERMS AS WOULD SERVED TO LIMIT THE EVENTS TO ANY PARTICULAR PLACE OR GIVE A CLEE AS TO THE PEOPLE CONCERNED
1580-141083-0001 I HAD ALWAYS KNOWN HIM TO BE RESTLESS IN HIS MANNER BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION HE WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF UNCONTROOLABLE AGITATION THAT IT WAS CLEAR SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL HAD OCCURRED
1580-141083-0002 MY FRIEND'S TEMPER HAD NOT IMPROVED SINCE HE HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THE CONGUNENIAL SURROUNDINGS OF BAKER STREET
1580-141083-0003 WITHOUT HIS SCRAP BOOKS HIS CHEMICALS AND HIS HOMELY AN TIDINESS HE WAS AN INCOMFORTABLE MAN
1580-141083-0004 I HAD TO READ IT OVER CAREFULLY AS THE TAXT MUST BE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT
1580-141083-0005 I WAS ABSENT RATHER MORE THAN AN HOUR

1580-141083-0007 THE MOA I LOOKED AT MY TABLE I WAS AWARE THAT SOMEONE HAD RUBMAGE'D AMONG MY PAPERS
1580-141083-0008 THE PROOF WAS IN THREE LONG SLIPS I HAD LEFT HIM ALL TOGETHER
1580-141083-0009 THE OLDTURN OF WAS THAT SOME ONE PASSING HAD OBSERVED THE KEY IN THE DOOR HAD KNOWN THAT I WAS OUT AND HAD ENTERED TO LOOK AT THE PAPERS
1580-141083-0010 I GAVE HIM A LITTLE BRANDY AND LEFT HIM COLLAPED IN A CHAIR WILL I MADE A MOST CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE ROOM

1995-1837-0008 WHERE WAS THE USE OF IMAGINING
1995-1837-0009 THE LUEGOON HAD BEEN LEVEL WITH THE DIKS AWAK AGO AND NOW
1995-1837-0010 PERHAPS SHE TOO MIGHT BE THERE WAITING WEEPING
1995-1837-0011 HE STARTED AT THE THOUGHT HE HURRIED FOR IT SADLY
1995-1837-0012 HE SPLASHED TO STAMDPED ALONG FTHER AND FARTHER ONWARD UNTIL HE NEAR THE RAMPARD OF THE CLEARING AND PUT FOOT UPON THE THREE BRIDGE
1995-1837-0013 THEN HE LOOKED DOWN THE LEGOON WAS DRY
1995-1837-0014 HE STOOD A MOMENT BEWILDERED THEN TURNED AND RUSHED UPON THE ISLAND A GREAT SHEET OF DAZZLING SUNLIGHT SWEPT THE PLACE AND BENEEED LAY A MIGHTY MASS OF A ALL OF GREEN THICK TALL WET AND WILLOW
1995-1837-0015 THE SQUAREESE OF COTTON SHARP EDGED HEAVY WERE JUST ABOUT TO BURST OF BULLS
1995-1837-0016 BUT ONE LONG MOANY PAUSED STOUPID A GATE WITH UTTER AMAZEMENT THENLY DIZZILY AGAINST A TREE
1995-1837-0017 HE GAZED ABOUT REPLEXED ASTONISHED
1995-1837-0018 HERE LAY THE READING OF THE RIDDLE WITH INFINITE WORK AND PAIN SOMEW ONE HAD DOTHER CANAL FROM THE LEGO TO THE CREEK INTO WHICH THE FORMER HAD DRAINED BY LONG ANDQOOKED WAY THUS ALLOWING IT TO EMPTY DIRECTLY
1995-1837-0019 HE SAT DOWN WEEAK BEWILDERED AND ONE THOUGHT WAS UPPER MOST SAOR
1995-1837-0020 THE YEARS OF THE DAYS OF HER DING WERE TEN
1995-1837-0021 THE HOPE AND DREAM OF HARVEST WAS UPON THE LAND
1995-1837-0022 UP IN THE SICK ROOMS OR A LAY ON THE LITTLE WHITE BED
1995-1837-0023 THE NET AND WEB OF ENDLESS THINGS HAD BEEN CRAWLING AND CREEPING AROUND HER SHE HAD STRUGGLED IN DUM SPEECHLESS TERROR AGAINST SOME MIGHTY GRASPING THAT STROLL FOR HER LIFE WAS GNARLED AND CREEPING FINGERS BUT NOW AT LAST WEEKLY SHE OPENED HER EYES AND QUESTION
1995-1837-0024 FOR WHILE SHE LAY IN HER CHAIR INHAPPY DREAMY PLEASURE AT SON AND BIRD AND TREE
1995-1837-0025 SHE ROLLS WITH A FLEETING GLANCE GATHERED THE SHAWL AROUND HER THEN GLIDING FORWARD WAVERING TREMULOUS SLIPP ACROSS THE ROAD AND INTO THE SWAMPTH
1995-1837-0026 SHE HAD BEEN BORN WITHIN ITS BORS WITHIN HIS BORDER SHE HAD LIVED IN GROAN AND WITHIN ITS BORDER SHE HAD MET HER LOVE
1995-1837-0027 ON SHE HURRIED UNTIL SWEEPING DOWN TO THE LEGOON AND THE ISLAND LOW THE COTTON LAY BEFORE HER
1995-1837-0028 THE CHAIR WAS EMPTY BUT HE KNEW
1995-1837-0029 HE DARTED THROUGH THE TREES AND PAUSED A TALL MAN STRONGLY BUT SLIMLY MADE
2094-142345-0000 IT IS A VERY FINE OLD PLACE OF RED BRICK SOFTENED BY A PAAL POWDERY LICHN WHICH HAS DISPERSED ITSELF WITH HAPPY IRREGULARITY SO AS TO BRING THE RED BRICK INTER TERMS OF FRIENDLY CONPANIONSHIP WITH A LIME STONE ORNAMENTS SURROUNDING THE THREE GABLES THE WINDOWS AND THE DOOR PLACE
2094-142345-0001 BUT THE WINDOWS ARE PATCHED WITH WOODENTAINS AND THE DOOR I THINK IS LIKE THE GATE IT IS NEVER OPENED
2094-142345-0002 FOR IT IS A SOLID HEAVY HANDSOME DOOR AND MUST ONCE HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF SHUTTING WITH A SONOROUS BAYING BEHIND THE LIVERIED LACKY WHO HADJUS SEEN HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS OFF THE GROUNDS IN A CARRIAGE AND PAIR
2094-142345-0003 A LARGE OPEN FIRE PLACE WITH RUSTY DOGS IN IT AND A BARE BOARDED FLOOR AT THE FAR END FLEECES OF WOOL STACKED UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR SOME EMPTY CORN BAGGS
2094-142345-0004 AND WHAT THROUGH THE LEFTAN WINDOW

2094-142345-0006 AT THE EDGE OF THIS BOX THERE LIES A GREAT WOODENLL WHICH SOAR AS MUTILATION IS CONCERN BEARS THE STRONG RESEMBLANCE TO THE FINESTREEK SCULPTURE AND ESPECIALLY IN THE TOTAL LOSS OF ITS NOSE
2094-142345-0007 THE HISTORY OF THE HOUSE IS PLAIN NOW
2094-142345-0008 BUT THERE IS ALWAYS A STRONGER SENSE OF LIFE WHEN THE SUN IS BRILLIANT AFTER RAIN AND NOW HE IS POURING DOWN HIS BEAMS IN MAKING SPARKLES AMONG THE WET STRAW AND LIGHTING UP EVERY PATCH A VIVID GREEN MOSS ON THE RED TILES OF THE COWTSHD AND TURNING EVEN THE MUDY WATER THAT IS HURRYING ALONG THE CHANNEL TO THE DRAIN INTO A MIRRER FOR THE YELLOW BUILD DUCKS WHO ARE CZING THE OPPORTUNITY OF GETTING A DRINK WITH AS MUCH BODY IN IT IS POSSIBLE
2094-142345-0009 FOR THE GREAT BARN DOORS ARE THROWN WIDE OPEN AND MEN OR BUSI THERE MENDING THE HARNESS UNDER THE SUPERINTENDENTS OF MISTER GOBY THE WIDDAW OTHER WISES SADDLER WHO ENTERTAINS THEM WITH A LATST TREADLESTON GOSSIP
2094-142345-0010 HADY SIRREL OFTEN TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY WHEN HER ANTS BACK WAS TURNED OF LOOKING AT THE PLEASING REFLECTION OF HERSELF IN THOSE POLISHED SERVICES FOR THE OAK TABLE WAS USUALLY TURNED UP LIKE A SCREEN AND WAS MORE FOR ORNAMENT THAN FOR USE AND SHE COULD SEE HERSELF SOMETIMES IN THE GREAT ROUND PUTTER DISHES THEY WERE RANGED ON THE SHELLVES ABOVE THE LONG DEAL DIDNER TABLE OR IN THE HOBS OF THE GREAT WHICH ALWAYS SHOWONN LIKE JASPER
2094-142345-0011 DO NOT SUPPOSE HOWEVER THAT MISSUS POYSER WAS ELDERLY OR SHREWISH IN HER APPEARANCE SHE WAS A GOOD LOOKING WOMAN NOT MORE THAN EIGHT IN THIRTY A FAIR COMPLEXION AND SANDY HAIR WHILE SHAPEN LIKE FOOTED
2094-142345-0012 THE FAMILY LIKENESS BETWEEN HER AND HER NIECE DYINIMAMORUS WITH A CONTRAST BETWEEN HER KEENNESS AND DNIS SERRAPHIC GENTLENESS OF EXPRESSION MIGHT HAVE SERVED A PAINTER AS AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION FOR A MARTHA AND MERRY
2094-142345-0013 HER TONGUE WAS NOT LESS KEEN THAN HER EYE AND WHENEVER A DAMSOL CAME WITH A EYAR SHOT SEEMED TO TAKE UP AN UNFINISHEDLU LOOKURE AS A BARREL ORGAN TAKES UPP A TOUN PRECISELY AT THE POINT WHERE IT HAD LEFT OFF
2094-142345-0014 THE FACT THAT IT WAS TURNING DAY WAS ANOTHER REASON WHILY IT WAS INCONVENIENT TO HAVE THE WIT US AND WHY CONSEQUENTLY MISSUS POYSER SHOULD SCOLD MOLLY THE HOUSE MADEAID WITH UNUSUAL SEVERITY
2094-142345-0015 D ALL APPEARANCE MOLLIE HAD GOT THROUGH HER AFTER IN HER WORK IN AN EXEMPL MANNER HAD CLEANED HERSELF WITH GREAT DESPATCH AND NOW CAME TO ASK SUBMISSIBLY IF SHE SHOULD SIT DOWN TO HER SPINNING TILL MILKING TIME
2094-142345-0016 SPITTING INDEED
2094-142345-0017 I NEVER NEW AR EQUALS FOR GALOWSNESS

2094-142345-0028 NO NO NO TTDY'D GET HER FEET WET SAID MISSUS POYSER CARRYING AWAY HER IRON
2094-142345-0029 DID EVER ANYBODY SEE THE LIKE SCREAMED OF MISS HIS POYSER RUNNING TOWARDS THE TABLE WHEN HER EYE HAD FALLEN ON THE BLUE STREAM
2094-142345-0030 TDDY HOWEVER HAD DESCENDED FROM HER CHAIR WITH GREAT SWIFTNESS AND WAS ALREADY IN RETREAT TOWARDS THE DARY WITH A SORT OF WADDLING RUN AND AN AMOUNT OF FAT ON THE NAPE OF HER NECK WHICH MADE HER LOOK LIKE THE MEDAMORPHOSIS OF A WHITE SUCKLING PIG
2094-142345-0031 AND SHE WAS VERY FOUNDD OF VIEW TOO IN RACHEL
2094-142345-0032 I OFTEN HERD HER TALK OF VIEW IN THE SAME SORT OF WAY
2094-142345-0033 WHEN SHE HAD THAT MAN ILLNESS AND I WAS ONLY ELEVEN YEARS OLD SHE USED TO SAY YOU'LL HAVE A FRIEND ON EARTH IN YOUR AUNT RACHEL IF I AM TAKEN FROM YOU FOR SHE HAS A KIND HEART AND I'M SURE I FOUND IT SO
2094-142345-0034 AND THERE'S LINEN IN THE HOUSE AS I COULD WELL SPARE YOU FOR I GOT LOT'S A SHEETING AND TABLE CLOTHING AND TOWINGS ISN'T MADE UP
2094-142345-0035 BUT NOT MORE THAN WHAT'S IN THE BIBLE AND SAID DINAH
2094-142345-0036 NA DEAR AUNT YOU NEVER HEARD ME SAY THAT ALL PEOPLE ARE CALLED TO FORSAKE THEIR WORK IN THEIR FAMILIES
2094-142345-0037 WE CAN ALL BE SERVANTS OF GOD WHERE EVER OUR LOT IS CAST BUT HE GIVES US DIFFERENT SORTS OF WORK ACCORDING AS HE FITS USS FOR IT AND CALLS US TO IT
2094-142345-0038 I CAN NO MORE HELP SPENDING MY LIFE AND TRYING TO DO WHAT I CAN FOR THE SOULS OF OTHERS THEN YOU COULD HELP RUNNING IF YOU HEARD LITTLE TOTDY CRYING AT THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSE THE VOICE WOULD GO TO YOUR HEART YOU WOULD THINK THE DEAR CHILD WAS IN TROUBLE OR IN DANGER AND YOU COULDN'T REST WITHOUT RUNNING TO HELP HER IN COMFORT HER

2094-142345-0042 I AM A COMMON IMPATIENCE WITH YOU
2094-142345-0043 BY THIS TIME THAT TWO GENTLEMEN HAD REACHED THE PAALINGS AND HAD GOT DOWN FROM THEIR HORSES HE WAS PLAYING THEY MEANT TO COME IN
2094-142345-0044 SAID MISTER IRWINE WITH HIS STATELY CORDIALITY
2094-142345-0045 OH SIR DON'T MENTION IT SAID MISSUS POYSER
2094-142345-0046 MY DELIGHT IN YOUR KITCHEN
2094-142345-0047 POYSER IS NOT AT HOME MISS HE
2094-142345-0048 SAID CAPTAIN BONY THORNNE SITTING HIMSELF WHERE HE COULD SEE ALONG THE SHORT PASSAGE TO THE OPEN DIRY DOOR
2094-142345-0049 NO SIR HE ISN'T HE'S GONE TO RECITOR TO SEE MISTER WEST THE FACTOR ABOUT THE WOOL
2094-142345-0050 BUT THERE'S FATHER AND BARN SIR IF HE'D BE OF ANY USE
2094-142345-0051 NO THANK YOU I'LL JUST LOOK AT THE WALVES AND LEAVE A MESSAGE ABOUT THEM WITH YOUR SHEPHERD
2094-142345-0052 I MUST COME ANOTHER DAY AND SEE YOUR HUSBAND I WANT TO HAVE A CONSULTATIONED WITH HIM ABOUT HORSES
2094-142345-0053 FOR IF IS ANYWHERE ON THE FARM WE CAN SEND FOR HIM IN A MINUTE
2094-142345-0054 OH SIR SAID MISSUS POYSER RATHER ALARMED YOU WOULDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL
2094-142345-0055 BUT YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT THAN I' DOY SIR
2094-142345-0056 I THINK I SHOULD BE DOING YOU A SERVICE TO TURN YOU OUT OF SUCH A PLACE
2094-142345-0057 I KNOWS FRM IS IN BETTER ORDER THAN ANY OTHER WITHIN TEN MILES OF US AND AS FOR THE KITCHEN HE ADDED SMILING I DON'T BELIEVE THERE IS ONE IN THE KINGDOM TO BEAT IT
2094-142345-0058 BY THE BY I'VE NEVER SEE YOUR DIRY THERE MUST SEEE DARY MISSUS POYSER
2094-142345-0059 THIS MISSUS POSER SAID BLUSHING AND BELIEVING THAT THE CAPTAIN WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN HERMLTE PANS AND WOULD ADUST HIS OPINION OF HER TO THE APPEARANCE OF HER DAIRY
2094-142345-0060 OH I'VE NO DOUBT ITS AND CAPITAL ORDER
2300-131720-0000 THE PARIS PLAN LIKE THAT OF THE CRYSTAL PALACE WAS A TEMPORARY EXHIBIT
2300-131720-0001 THE LONDON PLANT WAS ST T EMPORARY BUT NOT PERMANENT SUPPLYING BEFORE IT WAS TORN OUT NO FEWER THAN THREE THOUSAND LAMPS IN HOTELS CHURCHES STORES AND DWELLINGS IN THE VICINITY OF HOLBORN IT
2300-131720-0002 THERE MASSIEERS JONSON AND HAMOR PUT INTO PRACTICE MANY OF THE IDEAS NOW STANDARD IN THE  ART AND SECURED MUCH USEFUL DAT OF FOR THE WORK IN NEW YORK OF WHICH THE STORY HAS JUST BEEN TOLD
2300-131720-0003 THE DNAMO ELECTRIC MACHINE THOUGHOSE SMALL WAS ROBUST FOR UNDER ALL THE VARYING SPEEDS OF WATER POWER AND THE VICISSITUDES OF THE PLANT TO WHICH IT BELONG IT CONTINUED AN ACTIVE USE UNTIL EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE SEVENTEEN YEARS
2300-131720-0004 OWING TO HIS INSISTENCE ON LOW PRESSURE DIRECT CURRENT FOR USE IN DENSELY POPULATED DISTRICTS AS THE ONLY SAFE AND TRULY UNIVERSAL PROFITABLE WAY OF DELIVERING ELECTRICAL ENERGY TO THE CONSUMERS ADISON HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY SPOKEN OF AS ANAPPONENT OF THE ALTERNATING CURRENT
2300-131720-0005 WHY IF WE ERECT STATION AT THE FALLS IT IS A GREAT ECONOMY TO GET IT UP TO THE CITY
2300-131720-0006 THERE SEEMS NO GOOD REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT IT WILL CHANGE
2300-131720-0007 BROUGHT AS THE PRAIRIES AND FREE AND THOUGHT AS THE WINDS THAT SWEPT THEM HE IS IDIO CENCRTICALLY OPPOSED TO LOSE AND WTEFUL NOTODS TO PLANS OF EMPIRE THAT NEGLECT THE POOR AT THE GATE
2300-131720-0008 ATTHING HE HAS DONE HAS BEEN AIMED THAT THE CONSUROBATION OF ENERGY THE CONTRACTION OF SPACE THE INTENSIFICATION OF CULTURE
2300-131720-0009 FOR SOME YEARS IT WAS NOT FOUND FEASIBLE TO OPERATE MOTORS ON ALTERNATING CURRANT CIRCUITS AND THAT REASON WAS OFTEN URGED AGAINST IT SERIOUSLY
2300-131720-0010 IT COULD NOT BE USED FOR ELECTRO PLATING OR DEPOSITION NOR COULD A CHARGE STORGE BATTERIES ALL OF WHICH ARE EASILY WITHIN THE AABILITY OF THE DIREURRENT
2300-131720-0011 BUT WHEN IT CAME TO BE A QUESTION OF LIGHTING A SCATTERED SUBURB A GROUP OF DWELLINGS ON THE OUTSKIRTS A REMOTE COUNTRY RESNENCE OR A FARMUTHS THE ALTERNATING CURRENT IN ELEMENTS SAVE ITS DANGER WAS ANDD' IDEAL
2300-131720-0012 ADISON WAS INTOLERANT OF SHAMON SHODY AND NOTHING WOULD SATISFYU HIM THAT COULD NOT STAND CROSS EXAMINATION BY MICH RESCOPE TESTUBE AND GAVONOMETER
2300-131720-0013 UNLESS HE COULD SECURE AN ENGINE OF SMOOTH RUNNING AND MORE EXACTLY GOVERNMENT REGULATED THAN THOSE AVALIBLE FOR HIS DNAAMO AND LAMP ATDISON REALIZE THAT HE WOULD FIND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE A STEADY LIGHT
2300-131720-0014 MISTER ADDISON WAS A LEADER FAR A HEAD OF THE TIME
2300-131720-0015 HE OBTAINED THE DESIRED SPEED AND LOAD WITH A FRICTION BREAK ALSO REGULATOR OF SPEED BUT WAITED FOR AN INDICATORED A VERIFYANT
2300-131720-0016 THEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO KNOWN WAY TO LUBERICATE AN ENGINE FOR CONTINUOUS RUNNING AND MISTER ATISON INFM ME THAT AS E MARIEN ENGINE STARTED BEFORE THE SHIP LEFT NEW YORK AND CONTINUED RUNNING UNTIL IT REACHED ITS HOME PORT SO AN ENGINE FOR HIS PURPOSES MUST PRODUCED LIGHT AT ALL TIMES
2300-131720-0017 EVISON HAD INSTLLD HIS HISTORIC FIRST GREAT CENTRAL STATION SYSTEM IN NEW YORK ON THE MULTIABLE ARCH SYSTEM COVERED BY HIS FEATER AND MAIN INVENTION WHICH RESULTED IN ANNDABLE SAVING IN THE COST OF CONDUCTORS AS AGAINST DESTRATE TOO WIRE SYSTEM THROUGHOUT OF THE TREE KIND
2300-131720-0018 HE SOON FORESW THAT STILL GREATER ECONEOMMY WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR COMMERCIAL SUCCESS NOT ALONE FOR THE LARGER TERRITORY OPENING BUT FOR THE COMPACT DISTRICT OF LARGE CITIES
2300-131720-0019 THE STRONG POSITION HELD BY THE ATCENT SYSTEM UNDER THE STRENUOUS COMPETITION THAT WAS ALREADY SPRINGING UP WAS ENORMOUSLY IMPROVED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF THE THREE WIRE SYSTEM AND HE GAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPETUS TO INCDCENTLIGHTING
2300-131720-0020 IT WAS SPECCHUALLY SUITED FOR A TRIAL PLAT ALSO IN THE EARLY DAYS WHEN YIELD OF SIX SO OR EIGHT LAMPS TO THE HORSE POWER WAS CONSIDER SUBJECT FOR CONGRATULATION
2300-131720-0021 THE STET CONDUCTORS WERE OF THE OVERHEAD WHOLE LINE CONSTRUCTION ADWARD INSTALLED BY THE CONSTRUCTION COMPANY THAT HAD BEEN ORGANIZED BY ADCENTE TO BUILD AN EQUIPE CENTRAL STATIONS
2300-131720-0022 MEANWHILE HE HAD CALLED UPON ME TO MAKE A REPORT OF THE THREE WIR SYSTEM KNOWN IN ENGLAND AS THE HOPKINSON BOTH DOCTOR JOHN HOPKINSON AND MISTER ADISENT BEING INDEPENDENT IN VENORS AT PRACTICALLY THE SAME TIME
2300-131720-0023 I THINK HE WAS PERHAPS MORE APPRECIATIVE THAT I WAS OF THE DISCIPLINE OF THE A ATDISENT CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR US TO WAIT UNTIL THE MORNING OF THE FOURTH BEFORE WE STARTED UP
2300-131720-0024 BUT THE PLANT RAN AND IT WAS THE FIRST THREE WIRE STATION IN THIS COUNTRY
2300-131720-0025 THEY WERE LATER USED AS RESERVED BCHINES AND FINALLY WITH THE ENGINE RETIRED FROM SERVICE AS PART OF THE COLLECTION OF A ATESNIA BUT THEY REMAINED IN PRACTICALLY AS GOOD CONDITION AS WHEN INSTALLED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE
2300-131720-0026 THE ARC LAMP IN STALLED OUTSIDE A CUSTOMERS PROMISES OR IN A CIRCUIT FOR PUBLIC STREET LIGHTING BURNED SO MANY HOURS NIGHTLY SO MANY NIGHTS IN THE MONTH AND WAS PAID FOR AT THAT RATE SUBJECT TO REBATE FOR HOURS WHEN THE LAMP MIGHT BE OUT THROUGH ACCIDENT
2300-131720-0027 EVISENT HELD THAT THE ELECTRICITY SOLD MUST BE MEASURED JUST LIKE GASS OR WATER AND HE PROCEEDED TO DEVELOP A MEETTER
2300-131720-0028 THERE WAS INFINITE SCPTICISM AROUND HIM ON THE SUBJECT AND WHILE OTHER INVENTORS WERE ALSO GIVING THE SUBJECT MERE THOUGHT THE PUBLIC TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT ANYTHING SO UTTERLY INTANGIBLE AS ELECTRICITY THAT COULD NOT BE SEEN OR WEIT AND ONLY GAVE SECONDARY EVIDENCE OF ITSELF AT THE EXACT POINTED USE COULD NOT BE BROUGHT TO ACCURATE REGISTRATION
2300-131720-0029 NCE THE ADISENT ELECTRLITIC METER IS NO LONGER USED DESPITEDE ITS EXCELLENT QUALITIES
2300-131720-0030 THE PRINCIPLE EMPLOYED IN THE ADISENT ELECTRLITIC METTER IS THAT WHICH EXEMPLIFIES THE POWER OF ELECTRICITY TO DEONPOSE ACHEMICAL SUBSTANCE
2300-131720-0031 ASSOCIATED WITH THE SIMPLE FORM OF APPARATOUS WERE VARIOUS INGENIOUS DETAILS AND REFINEMENTS TO SECURE REGULARITY OF OPERATION FREEDOM FROM INACCURACY AND IMMUNITY FROM SUCH TAMPERING AS WOULD PERMIT THEFT OF CURRENT OR DAMAGE
2300-131720-0032 THE STANDARD ATIS IN MEEDRE PRACTICE WAS TO REMOVE THE CELLVES ONCE AMONTH TO THE METOR ROOM OF THE CENTRAL STATION COMPANY FOR EXAMINATION ANOTHER SAT BEING SUBSTITUTED
2300-131720-0033 INDCEMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT MISTER DBT J JENKS READ AN INTERESTING PAPER BEFORE THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS ON THE SIX YEARS OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE HAD UP TO THAT TIME WITH THE MEETTER THEN MORE GENERALLY IN USEN ANY OTHER
2300-131720-0034 THE OTHERS HAVING BEEN AN OPERATION TOO SHORT A TIME TO SHOW DEFINITE RESULTS ALTHOUGH THEY ALSO WHEN QUICKLY TO A DIVIDE AND BASIS
2300-131720-0035 IN THIS CONNECTION IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED THAT THE ASSOCIATION OF ADISENT ILLUMINATING COMPANIES IN THE SAME YEAR ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS UNANIMUSLATE TO THE EFFECT THAT THE INNCENT METER WAS ACCURATE AND THAT ITS USE WAS NOT EXPENSIVE FOR STATIONS ABOVE ONE THOUSAND LIGHTS AND THAT THE BEST FINCIAL RESULTS WERE IN VARIABLY SECURED IN A STATION SELLING CURRENT BY METER
2300-131720-0036 THE METTER CONTINUED IN GENERAL SERVICE DURING EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE AND PROBABLY UP TO THE CLOTHSES OF THE CENTURY
2300-131720-0037 HE WAHED AND REWAY THE METTER PLATES AND PURSUED EVERY LINE OF INVESTIGATION IMAGINABLE BUT ALL IN VAIN
2300-131720-0038 HE FELT HE WAS UP AGAINST IT AND THAT PERHAPS AN OTHER KIND OF A JOB WOULD SUIT HIM BETTER
2300-131720-0039 THE PROBLEM WAS SOALVED
2300-131720-0040 WE WERE MORE INTERESTED IN THE TECHNICAL CONDITION OF THE STATION THAN IN THE COMMERCIAL PART
2300-131720-0041 WE HAD MES IN WHICH THERE WERE TWO BOTTLES OF LIQUID
237-126133-0000 HERE SHE WOULD STAY COMFORTED AND SOOE AMONG THE LOVELY PLANTS AND RICH EXOTICS REJOICING THE HEART OF OLD TURNER THE GARDENER WHO SINCE POLLY'S FIRST RAPTROUS ENTRANCE HAD TAKEN HER INTO HIS GOOD GRACES FOR ALL TIME
237-126133-0001 EVERY CHANCE SHE COULD STEAL AFTER PRACTISE HOURS WERE OVER AND AFTER THE CLAMOREST A MANANDS OF THE BOYS UPON HER TIME WERE FULLY SATISFIED WAS CEIASED TOFLY ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND TO THE FLOWERS
237-126133-0002 THEN DEAR SAID MISSUS WHITNEY YOU MUST BE KINDED TO HER THAN EVER THINK WHAT IT WOULD BE FOR ONE OF YOU TO BE AWAY FROM HOME EVEN AMONG FRIENDS
237-126133-0003 SOMEHOW OF ALL THE DAYS WHEN THE HOME FEELING WAS THE STRONGEST THIS DAY IT SEEMED AS IF SHE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER
237-126133-0004 IF SHE COULD ONLY SEED PHRONSIE FOR JUST ONE MOMENT
237-126133-0005 OH SHE'S ALWAYS AT THE PIANO SAID MAN SHE MUST BE THERE NOW SOMEWHERE AND THEN SOMEBODY LAUGHED
237-126133-0006 AT THIS THE BUNDLE OPENED SUDDENLY AND OUT POPPED PHRONSIE
237-126133-0007 BUT POLLY COULDN'T SPEAK AND OF JASPER HADN'T COUTHTTERED JUST IN TIME SHE WOULD HAVE TUMBLED OVER BACKWARD FROM THE STOOL PHRONSIE AND ALL

237-126133-0015 YES ALL ALONE BY HIMSELF ASSERTED JASPER VEHEMENTLY AND WINKING PURIOUSLY TO THE OTHERS TO STOP THEIR LAUGHING HE DID NOW TRULY PRONSIE

237-126133-0020 HOW DID HER MOTHER EVER LET HER GO
237-126133-0021 SHE ASKED IMPULSIVELY I DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU COULD PERSUADE HER FATHER
237-126133-0022 I DIDN'T HAVE ANY FEARS IF I WORKED IT RFLY SAID THE OLD GENTLEMEN COMPLACENTLY
237-126133-0023 HE CRIED AND HIGH DOUDGEON JUST AS IF HE OWNED THE WHOLE OF THE PECKPS AND COULD DISPOSE OF THEM ALL HIS SOIT HIS FANCY
237-126133-0024 AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS SO DELIGHTED WITH HIS SUCCESS THAT HE HAD TO BURST OUT INTO A SRIIES OF SHORT HAPPY BITS OF LAUGHTER THAT OCCUPIED QUITE A SPACE OF TIME
237-126133-0025 AT LAST HE CAME OUT OF THEM AND WIPED HIS FACE VIGOROUSLY
237-134493-0000 IT ISIXTEEN YEARS SINCE JOHN BURKS AND DIED
237-134493-0001 HIS WIFE NOW EYES BESIDE HIM AND THE WHITE SHAFT THAT MARKS THEIR GRAVES GLEAMS ACROSS THE WHEAT FIELDS
237-134493-0002 FROM THE NORWGIAN GRAVEYARD ONE LOOKS OUT OVER A VAST CHECKERBOARD MARKED OFF IN SQUARES OF WHEAT AND CORN LIGHT AND DARK DARK AND LIGHT
237-134493-0003 FROM THE GRAVE YARD GATE ONE KCWNT A DOZEN GAILY PAINTED FARMHUSS THE GILDED WEATHER VEINS ON THE BIG RED BARNS WEAK AT EACH OTHER ACROSS THE GREEN AND BROWN ON YELLOW FIELDS
237-134493-0004 THE AIR AND THE ER TH CURIOUSLY MADETED AND INTERMNGLED AS IF THE ONE WERE THE BREATH OF THE OTHER
237-134493-0005 HE WAS A SPLENDID FIGURE OF A BOY TALL AND STREIGHT AS A YOUNG PINE TREE WITH A HANDSOME HEAD AND STORMY GRAY EYES DEEPLY SET UNDER RE SERIOUS BROW

237-134500-0002 A BRISQ WIND HAD COME UP AND WAS DRIVING PUFFY WHITE CLOUDS ACROSS THE SKY
237-134500-0003 THE ORCHARD WAS SPARKLING AND RIPPLING IN THE SUN

237-134500-0013 MAER PICKED  CHERRYES AND SAING SOFTLY TO HERSELF STRIPPING ONE GLITTERING RANCH AFTER ANOTHER SHIVERING WHEN SHE CAUGHT A SHOWER OF RAIN DROPS ON HER NECK AND HAIR
237-134500-0014 AND AMIEL MOE HIS WAY SLOWLY DOWN TOWARD THE JERRY TREES
237-134500-0015 THAT SUMMER THE RAINS HAD BEEN SO MANY AND OPPORTUNE THAT IT WAS ALMOST MORE THAN CHBATA AND HIS MAN COULD DO TO KEEP UP WITH THE CORN THE ORCHARD WAS AN NEGLECTED WILDERNESS

260-123286-0000 SATURDAY AUGUST FIFTEENENT THE SEA AND BROKEN ALL ROUND NO LAND IN SIGHT
260-123286-0001 THE HORIZON SEEMS EXTREMELY DISTANT

260-123286-0010 SUNDAY AUGUST SIXTEENTH
260-123286-0011 NOTHING NEW WHETHER UNCHANGED THE WIND FRESHS
260-123286-0012 BUT THERE SEEMED NO REASON A FEAR
260-123286-0013 THE SHADOW OF THE RAFT WAS CLEARLY OUTLIN UPON THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES
260-123286-0014 TRULY THE SEA IS OF INFINENTE WIT
260-123286-0015 IT MUST BE AS WIDE AS THE METITERRANEAN OR THE ATLANTIC IN WHYIGHT
260-123286-0016 THESE THOUGHTS AGITATED ME ALL DAY AND MY IMAGINATION SCARCELY CALM DOWN AFTER SEVERAL HOUR SLEEVE
260-123286-0017 I SHUDDER AS I RECALL THESE MONSTERS TO MY REMEMBERS

260-123286-0022 TWO HOURS AFTERWARDS A TERRIBLE SHOCK A WOKE ME
260-123286-0023 THE RAFT WAS HEAVED UP ON A WATETERRY MOUNTAIN AND PITCHED DOWN AGAIN AT A DISTANCE OF TWENTY FATHOWS

260-123286-0025 FLIGHT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION NOW THE REPTAILS ROSE THEY WHEELED AROUND OUR LITTLE RAFT WITH A RAPIDITY GREATER THAN THAT OF EXPRESSED TRAINS

260-123288-0000 THE ROARINS BECOME LOST IN THE DISTANCE
260-123288-0001 THE WEATHER IF WE MAY USE THE TERROR WILL CHANGE BEFORE LAW
260-123288-0002 THE ATMOSPHER IS CHARGED WITH VAPOURS PROVADED WITH THE ELECTRICITY GENERATED BY THE AVAPORATION OF SAILING WATERS
260-123288-0003 THE ELECTRIC LIGHT CAN SCARCELY PENETRATE TO THE DANCE CURON WHICH IS DROPPED OVER THE THEATRE ON WHICH THE BATTLE OF THE ELEENCE IS ABOUT TO BE WAGED
260-123288-0004 THE AIR IS HEAVY THE SEA IS CALM
260-123288-0005 FROM TIME TIME A FLEASY TUOUGHT OF MINESS WITH YET SOME GLEAMING LIGHT LEFT UPON IT DROPPED DOWN UPON THE DS FLOUR OF GY AND LOSES ITSELF IN THE OAKE AND IMPENETRABLE MASS

260-123288-0022 I SEEM TO BE WE ARE LOST BUT I AM NOT SURE
260-123288-0023 HE NODHDT HIS CONSENT
260-123288-0024 THE FARE BAALL HALF OF IT WHIDE HALF AZUR BLUE AND THE SIZE OF A TEN INT SHELL MOVED SOOWLY ABOUT THE RAFT BUT REVOLVING ON ITS OWN ACCESISS WITH ASTONISHINGVELOCITY AS IF WHIPPED ROUND BY THE FORCE OF THE WHIRLWIND

260-123440-0006 A HOW WOULDEDER IF I'VE BEEN CHAGED IN THE NIGHT
260-123440-0007 I ALMOST THINK I CAN REMBER FEELING A LITTLE DIFFERENT
260-123440-0008 I'LL TRY IF I KNOW ALL THE THINGS I USED TO KNOW
260-123440-0009 I SHALL NEVER GET A TWENTY AT THAT RATE
260-123440-0010 HOW CHEERFULLY HE SEEMS TO GRIN HOW NEATLY SPREAD HIS CALLS AND WELCOME LITTLE FISHES IN WITH GENTLY SMILING JOAWS

260-123440-0016 I SHALL BE PUNISHED FOR IT NOW I SUPPOSE BY BEING TROWUNDNED IN MY OWN TEARS
260-123440-0017 THAT WE'LL BE AQUEER THING FOR TO BE SURE
260-123440-0018 I AM VERY TIRE TO SWIMMING ABOUT HERE OH MASE
260-123440-0019 CRIED ALICE AGAIN FOR THIS TIME THE MOUSE WAS BRISTLING ALL OVER AND SHE FELT CERTAIN IT MUST BE REALLY OFFENDED
260-123440-0020 WE WON'T TALK ABOUT HER ANY MORE IF YOU'D RATHER NOT WE INDEED
2830-3979-0000 WE WANT YOU TO HELP US PUBBLISH SOME LEADING WORK OF LUTHERS FOR THE GENERAL AMERICAN MARKET WILL YOU DO IT
2830-3979-0001 THE CONDITION IS THAT I WILL BE PERMITTED TO MAKE LUTHERTHER TALK AMERICAN STREAMLN HIM SO TO SPEAK BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER GET PEOPLE WHETHER IN OR OUTSIDE THE LUTHER IN CHURCH ACTUALLY TO READ LUTHER UN MULESS WE MAKE HIM TALK AS HE WOULD TALK TO DAY TO AMERICANS
2830-3979-0002 LET US BEGIN WITH THAT HIS COMMENTARY UNGOLATIONS
2830-3979-0003 THE UNDERTAKING WHICH SEEMS SOTRACTIVE WHEN VIEWED AS A LITERARY TASK PROVED THE MOST DIFFICULT ONE AND A TIMES BECAME OPPRESSIVE
2830-3979-0004 IT WAS WRITTEN IN LATIN
2830-3979-0005 THE WOR HAD TO BE CONDENCD
2830-3979-0006 A WORD SHOULD NOW BE SAID ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF LUTHER'SE COMMONAR ANGOLATIONS
2830-3979-0007 MUCH LATER WHEN A FRIEND OF HIS WAS PREPARING AN ADDITION OF ALL HIS LATIN WORKS HE REMARK TO HIS HOME CIRCLE IF I HAD MY WAY ABOUT IT THEY WOULD REPUBLISH ONLY THOSE OF MY BOOKS WHICH HAVE DOCTRINE MI GLATIONS FOR INSTANCE AND
2830-3979-0008 IN OTHER WORDS THESE THREE MEN TOOK DOWN THE LECTXURES WHICH LUTHER ADDRESSED TO HIS STUDENCE AND THE COURSE OF GLATIONS AND ROAR PREPARED THE MANUSCRIPT FOR THE PRINTER
2830-3979-0009 IT PRESENTS LIKE NO OTHER OF LUTHER'S WRITINGS THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF CHRISTIANITY THE JEUSTIFICATION OF THE CINNER FOR THE SAKE OF CHRIST MERITS ALONE
2830-3979-0010 BUT THE ESSENCE OF LUIS LECTURURES IS THERE
2830-3979-0011 THE LORD WHO HAS GIVEN US POWER TO TEACH AND TO HEAR LET HIM ALSO GIVE US THE POWER TO SERVE AND TO DO LOTE TOO
2830-3979-0012 THE WORD OF OUR GOD SHALL STAND FOREVER
2830-3980-0000 IN EVERY WAY THEY SOUGHT TO UNDERMIND THE AUTHORITY OF SAINT PAUL
2830-3980-0001 THEY SAID TO THE GLATIONS YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO THINK HLY OF PAW
2830-3980-0002 HE WAS THE LAST TO TURN THE CHRIST
2830-3980-0003 KALKAM LATER IN HIS BENEATH US
2830-3980-0004 INDEED HE PERSECUTED THE CHURCH OF CHRIST FOR A LONG TIME
2830-3980-0005 DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT GOD FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW MOTHER IN HERERITICS WOULD THIS OWN HIS ENTIRE CHURCH
2830-3980-0006 AGAINST THESE BOASTING FALSEOPOSTILS PUL BOLTHDLY DEFENCE HIS APPSTOLIC AUTHORITY IN MINISTRY
2830-3980-0007 AS THE AMBASSADOR OF A GOVERNMENT IS HONOORED FOR HIS OFFICE AND NOT FIRST PRIVATE PERSON SO THE MINISTER OF CRIES SHOULD EXALT HIS OFFICE IN ORDERS TO AGAINA AUTHORITY AMONG MEN
2830-3980-0008 PALTICS PRIDE HIS MINISTRY NOT TO HIS OWN PRAISE BUT TO THE PRAISE OF GOD
2830-3980-0009 PALE AN APOSTIL NOT OF MEN ET CETERA
2830-3980-0010 EITHER HE CALLS MINISTERS THROUGH THE AGENCY OF MEN OR HECALLSED THEM DIRECTLY AS HE CALLED THE PROFITS AND A POSTILS
2830-3980-0011 PULLED DECLAARS THAT THE FALSE OFPOSTLES WERE CALLED THEIR CENT NEITHER BY MEN NOR BY MAN
2830-3980-0012 THE MOST THEY COULD CLAIM AS THAT THERE WERE SENT BY OTHERS
2830-3980-0013 HE MENTIONEDS THE APOSTLES FIRST BECAUSE THERE WEREPINTED DIRECTED BY GOD
2830-3980-0014 THECALL IS NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY
2830-3980-0015 FOR PERSON TO POSSESS KNOWOWLEDGES NOT ENOUGH
2830-3980-0016 IS SPOILS ONE'S BEST WORK
2830-3980-0017 WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN I THOUGHT PAUL WAS MAKING TOO MUCH OF HIS COLL
2830-3980-0018 I DID NOT THEN REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MINISTRY
2830-3980-0019 IM NOTHING OF THE DOCTRRINE E FAITH BECAUSE WE WERE TAUGHT SO FATRENSEAD IS CERTAINTY AND NOBODY UNDERSTOOD SPIRITUAL BOASTING
2830-3980-0020 THIS IS NO SENFUL PRIDE IT IS WHOLLY PRIDE
2830-3980-0021 AND GOD THE FATHER WHO RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD
2830-3980-0022 THE CALASEMED SUPERVLOUS ON FIRST SIGHT
2830-3980-0023 THESE PERVERS OF THE RIGHTCHENESS OF CHRIST RESIST THE FATHER AND THE SON AND THE WORKS OF THEM BOTH
2830-3980-0024 IN THIS WHOLE PISTLE PUL TREATS OF THE RESURRECTION IN CHRIST
2830-3980-0025 BY HIS RESURRECTION CHRIST ONE THE VICTORY OVER LAW SIN FLESH WORLD DEVIL DEATH HELL AND EVERY EVIL
2830-3980-0026 FIRST TWO
2830-3980-0027 AND ALL THE BRETHOOM WHICH ARE WITH ME
2830-3980-0028 THIS SHOULD GO FAR AND SHUTTING THE MOTHE OF THE FALSEPSSS
2830-3980-0029 ALTHOUGH THE BRETHERN WITH ME ARE NOT A POCILS LIKE MYSELF YET THEY ARE ALL OF ONE MIND WITH ME THINK RIGHT AND TEACHES I DO
2830-3980-0030 THEY DO NOT GO WHERE THE ENEMIES OF THE GOSPEL PDOMINATE THEY GO WERE THE CHRIESANS ARE
2830-3980-0031 WRD THEN ON INVADYED THE CATHOLIC PROVINCES AND PREACHED THEIR DOCTRNE TO GODMS PRINCES BISHOPS AND DOCTORS AS WE HAVE DONE BY THE HELP OF GOD
2830-3980-0032 WE LOOK FOR THAT REWARD WHICH I HAVE NOT SEEN NOR EAR HEARD NEITHER HAVE ENTERED INTO THE HEART OF MAN
2830-3980-0033 NOT ALL THE GLATIONS HAD BECOME PVERTED
2830-3980-0034 THESE MEANS CANNOT BE CONTAMINATE
2830-3980-0035 THEY REMAINED DIVINE REGARDLESS OF ME IN' OPINION
2830-3980-0036 WHEREVER THE MEANS OF GRACEER FOUND THERE IS THE HOLY CHURCH EVEN THOUGH ANTI GRAST RENES THERE
2830-3980-0037 SO MUCH FOR THE TITLE OF THE A PISTOL NOW FOLLOWS THE GREETING OF THE APOSTSILOR VERSE THREE
2830-3980-0038 GRACE ME TO YOU AND PEACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND FROM OUR LORD YESUS CHRIST
2830-3980-0039 THE TERMS OF GRACE AND PIECE ARE COMMON TERMS WITH PAUL AND ARE NOW PRETTY WELL UNDERSTOOD
2830-3980-0040 THE GREADING OF THE APOSTELS REFRESHION
2830-3980-0041 GRACE ANDVLLS THE REOMMISSION OF SINDS PEACE AND A HAAPPY CONSCIENCE
2830-3980-0042 THE WORLD BRAND'S THIS OF PERNICIOUS DOCTRINE
2830-3980-0043 EXPERIENCE PROVES THIS
2830-3980-0044 HOWEVER THE GRACE AND PIECE OF GOD WILL
2830-3980-0045 MEN SHOULD NOT SPECULATE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
2830-3980-0046 WAS IT NO NOT ENOUGH TO SAY FROM GOD THE FATHER
2830-3980-0047 TO DO SO AS TO LOSE GOT ALTOGETHER BECAUSE GOD BECOMES INTOLERABLE WHEN WE SEEK TO MEASURE INTO COMPREHEND HIS INFINITE MAJESTY
2830-3980-0048 HE CAME DOWN TO EARTH LIVED AMONG MEN SUFFERED WAS CRUCIFIED AND THEN HE DIED STANDING CLEARLY BEFORE US SO THAT OUR HEARTS AND EYES MAY FASTEN UPON HIM
2830-3980-0049 EMBRACE HIM AND FORGET ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
2830-3980-0050 DID NOT CHRIST HIMSELF SAY I AM THE WAY IN THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE NO MAN COMETH UNTO THE FATHER BUT BY ME
2830-3980-0051 WHEN YOU ARE YOU ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD APAR FROM THE QUESTION OF JEUSTIFICATION YOU MAY BE AS PROFOUND AS YOU LIKE
2830-3980-0052 WE ARE TO HEAR CHRIST WHO HAS BEEN APPOINTED BY THE FATHER AS OUR DIVINE TEACHER
2830-3980-0053 AT THE SAME TIME PAL CONFIRMS ARE CREAT THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD
2830-3980-0054 THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD IS APPARENT IN THAT PAULSCRIBED HIM DIVINE POWERS EQUALLY WITH THE FATHER AS FOR INSTANCE THE POWER TO THE SPENSE GRACE AND PEACE
2830-3980-0055 TO A STOW PEACE AND GRACE LIES IN THE PROVINCE OF GOD WHO ALONE CON CREATE THESE BLESSINGS THE ANGELS CANNOT
2830-3980-0056 OTHERWISE PAULSED SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN GRACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND PIECE FROM OUR LORD JES'US CHRIST
2830-3980-0057 THERIANS TOOK CHRICE FOR A NOBLE AND PERFECT CR REEATURES SUPERIOR EVEN TO THE ANGELS BECAUSE BY HIM GOD CREED HEAVEN AND EARTH
2830-3980-0058 MOHAMM IT ALSO SPE TALLY OF CHRIST
2830-3980-0059 POSTICS TO HIS THEME
2830-3980-0060 HE NEVER LOS HIS SIGHT OF THE PURPOSE OF HIS A PZZCLE
2830-3980-0061 NOT GOLDER SILVER OR PASSAL LAMBS OR AN ANGEL BUT HIMSELF WHAT FOR
2830-3980-0062 NOT FOR A CROWN OR A KINGDOM WERE ARE GOODNESS BEFORE SINS
2830-3980-0063 UNDERSCORE THESE WORDS FOR THEY ARE FULL OF COMFORT FOR SORE CONSCIENCES
2830-3980-0064 HOW MA WE OBTAINED REMISSION OF OUR SENS
2830-3980-0065 POOLANCERS THE MAN WHOS NAME JESUS CHRIST AND THE SON OF GOD GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINCE
2830-3980-0066 SINCE CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINDS IT STANDS TO REASON THAT THEY CANNOT BE PUT AWAY BY OUR OWN EFFORTS
2830-3980-0067 THIS SENTENCE ALSO TO FINDS OUR SINS AS GREAT SO GREAT IN FACT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD COULD NOT MAKE AMENDS FOR A SINGLE SEN
2830-3980-0068 THE GREATNESS OF THE RANSOM CHRIST SOME OF GOD INDICATES THIS
2830-3980-0069 THE VICIOUS CHARACTER OF SAND IS BROUGHT OUT BY THE WORDS WHO GAVE HIMSELF FOR A SINCE
2830-3980-0070 WILL WE ARE CARELESS WE MAKE LIGHTE OF SIN
2830-3980-0071 WE THINK THAT BY SOME LITTLE WORK OR MERIT WEAKING DISMISS IN
2830-3980-0072 THIS PASSAGE THEN THERE IS OUT THE FACT THAT ALL MANN OR SOLD UNDERERSIN
2830-3980-0073 THIS ATTITUDE SPRINGS FROM A FALSE CONCEPTION OF SIN THE CONCEPTION AS SIN AS A SMALL MATTER EASILY TAKEN CARE OF BY GOOD WORKS THAT WE MUST PRESENT OURSELVES ON TO GOD WITH A GOOD CONSCIENCE THAT WE MUST FEEL NO SIN BEFORE MAY FEEL THAT CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS
2830-3980-0074 THIS ATITUDE IS UNIVERSAL AND PARTICUALLY DEVELOPED IN THOSE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES BETTER OF THAN OTHERS
2830-3980-0075 BUT THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE AND COMFORT OF THE WORDS FOR OUR SINS IS LOST UPON THEM
2830-3980-0076 ON THE OTHER HAND WE ARE NOT TO REGARD THEM IS SO TERRIBLE THAT WE MUST DESPAIR
2961-960-0000 HE PASSES ABRUPTLY FROM PERSONS THE IDEAS IN NUMBERS AND FROM IDEAS AND NUMBERS THE PERSONS FROM THE HEAVENS DEMAND FROM ARONOMY TO PHYSIOLOG HE CONFUSES OR RATHER DOES NOT DISTINGUISH SUBJECT AND OBJECT FIRST AND FINAL CAUSES AND HIS DREAMING OF GIOMETRICAL FIGURES LOST IN A FLOPS OF SENSE
2961-960-0001 THE INFLUENCE WHICH THE TO ME US HAS EXERCISED UPON POSITY IS DUE PRLYTUAL MISUNDERSTANDING
2961-960-0002 IN DIS SUPPOSED DEPTHS OF THIS DIAABLE THE NEW PLATINOISTS FOUND HIDDEN MEANINGS IN CONNEXTIONS WITH THE JEWISH AND CHRISTIAN SCRIPTURES AND OUT OF THEM THEY ILLICITED DOCTRINES QUIET AT VARIANCE WITH THE SPEIRIT OF PLTO
2961-960-0003 THEY WERE ABSORVED IN HIS THEOLOGY AND WERE UNDER THE DOMINION OF HIS NAME WHILE THAT WHICH WAS TRULY GREAT IN TRULY CORRECTORISTIC IN HIM HIS EFFORT TO REALIZE IN CONNECT OBSTRCTIONS WAS NOT UNDERSTOOD BY THEM AT ALL
2961-960-0004 THERE IS OLD DANGER OF THE MODERN COMMONATURES ONOT MEUS FALLING AND ABSURDITIES OF THE NEO PLATINOISTS
2961-960-0005 IN THE PRESENT DAY WE ARE WELL A WEAR THAT AN ENTIENT PHILOSOPH IS TO BE TRIFRETED FROM HIMSELF AND BY THE CONTEMPORARY HISTORY OF THOUGHT
2961-960-0006 THE FANCIES OF THE MUAL PLATMIST ARE ONLY INTERESTING TO US BECAUSE THEY EXCITIT OFPHAASE OF THE HUMAN MIND WHICH PREVAIL WIDELING THE FIRST CENTURIES OF THE CHRISTIAN EUR IT AND IS NOT HOLLLY EXTINCT IN OUR OWN DAY
2961-960-0007 BUT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INTERPORTATION OF PLTAL AND IN SPIRIT THEY ARE OPPOSED TO HIM
2961-960-0008 WE DO NOT KNOW HOW PLTEL WOULD HAVE ARRANGED HIS OWN DIILS WERE WHETHER DE THOUGHT OF ARRANGING ANY OF THEM BESIDES TO TOUTRLITIES WHICH HE HAS EXPRESSLY CONNEITED WAS EVER PRESENT HIS MIND
2961-960-0009 THE DIAL OF IS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH ANIMAL CREATION INCLUDING UNDER THIS M THE HEAVILY BODIES AND WITH MAN ONLY AS ONE AMONG THE ANIMALS
2961-960-0010 BUT HE HAS NOT AS YET THE FIND THIS INTMMEDIATERITORY WHICH LI SOMEWHARE BETWEEN MEDICINE AND METHEMATICS AND HE WOULD HAVE FELT THAT THERE WAS AS GREAT AN IMPIETY INRINKING THEURIES OF PHYSICS FIRST IN THE ORDER OF KNOWLEDGE AS IN PLACING THE BODY BEFORE THE SOUL
2961-960-0011 WITH HERVOLATIS HE ACKNOWLEDGS THE PERPATUAL FLUS LIKE AN SAGRIUS HE ASSERVED THE PRODOLINENCE OF MIN ALTHOUGH ADMITTING AN ELEMENT OF NECESSITY WHICH REASON IS INCAPABLE OF SUBDUING LIKE THE PFEICARANS HE SUPPOSES THE MYSTERY OF THE WORLD TO BE CONTAINED IN NUMBER
2961-960-0012 MANY IF NOT ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THE PRESUAL CREDIC PHILOSOPHY ARE INCLUDED IN ATINUS
2961-960-0013 IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE RELATION OF THE IDEAS TO GOD OR OF GOD TO THE WORLD WAS DIFFERENTLY CONCEIVED BY HIM AT DIFFERENT TIME OF HIS LIFE
2961-960-0014 THE IDEAS ALSO REMAIN BUT THEY HAVE TOCOME TPES IN NATURE FORMS OF MEN ANIMAL SP BIRDS FISHES
2961-960-0015 THE STYLE AND PLAN OF THE TO MEUS DIFFERT GREATLY FROM THAT OF ANY OTHER OF THE PLATONIC DIALANTS
2961-960-0016 BUT POLINO HAS NOT THE SAME MASTERY OVER HIS INSTRUMENT WHICH HE EXHIBITS IN THE FEATURES OR SUPPOSEI HIM
2961-960-0017 NOTHING COULD EXCEED THE BEAUTY WERE AREIT OF INTRODUCTION IN WHICH HIS USING WORDS AFTER HIS ACCUSTOMED MANNER
2961-960-0018 BUT IN THE REST OF THE WORK THE POWER OF LANGUAGE SEEMS TOFIL HIM AND THE DRAMATIC FORM IS WHOLLY GIVEN UP
2961-960-0019 HE COULD RIGHT IN ONE STYLE BUT NOT IN ANOTHER THE GREEQ LANGUAGE HAD NOT AS YET BEEN FASHIONED BY ANY POUIT OR PHILOSOPHER TO DESCRIBE PHYSICAL PHENOMENA
2961-960-0020 AN HENCE WE FIND A SAME SORT OF CLUMSINESS IN THE TOMS OF PLATO WHICH CHARAACTTERIZES TO PHILI'SOPHICAL POM OF LUCREATIOUS
2961-960-0021 THERE IS A ONE OF FLOW AND OFTEN A DEFECT OF RHYTHM THE MEANING IS SOMETIMES OFBSCURE AND THERE IS A GREATER USE OF APPOSITION IN MORE OF REPETITION THAN OCCURS AND POLATOS EARLIER WRITANCE
2961-960-0022 PLTEL HAD NOT THE COMMAND OF HIS MATERIALS WHICH WOULD HAVE ENABLED HIM TO PRODUCE OF PERFECT WOR OURB
2961-961-0000 SOLRITIES BEGINS THE MEUS WITH A SUMMARE OF THE REPUBLIC
2961-961-0001 AND NOW HE DESIRES TO SEEAT THE IDEAL STATE SET IN MOTION WHO WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW SHE BEHAVED IN SOME GREAT STRUGGLE
2961-961-0002 AND THEREFORE TO YOU I TURN TO ME AS CITIZEN OF LAUS WHO ARE AT ONCE OF PHILOZOPHER AND A STATESMAN AND TO YOU CRTEUS WHOM ALL AFENIENTS KNOW TO BE SIMILARLY ACCOMPLISHED INTO HER MOCRITIESSE ALSO FITTED BY NATURE AND EDUCATION TO SHARE IN OUR DISCOURSE
2961-961-0003 I WILL IF TO ME AS A PROOVES I A PROOF
2961-961-0004 LISTEN THEN SOCRETIES TO AT TAIL OF SOLLENENCE WHO BEING THE FRIEND OF DROGUID US MY GREAT GRANDFATHER TOLT IT TO MY GRANDFATHER CREDUS AND HE TOLD ME
2961-961-0005 SOME POLEMS OF SOLLN WERE RECITED BY THE BOSE
2961-961-0006 AND WHAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE POLLO SAID THE PERSON WHO MADE THE REMARK
2961-961-0007 THE SUBJECT WAS A VERY NOBLE ONE HAD DESCRIBE THE MOST FAMOUS ACTION IN WHICH THEFFENIAN PEOPLE WERE EVER ENGAGED
2961-961-0008 FOR THE MEMORY OF THEIR EXPLOIT HAD PASSED AWAY OWING TO THE LAPSE OF TIME AND THE EXTINCTION OF THECTORS
2961-961-0009 TELL US SAID THE OTHER THE WHOLE STORY AND WE SOLEM HER THE STORY
2961-961-0010 BUT IN EACHYPT THE TRADITIONS OF OUR OWN AND OTHER LANDS ARE BY US REGISTERATE FOREVER IN OUR TEMPLES
2961-961-0011 THE GENIALLOGIES WHICH ARE HAVE RECITIIAL US OUT OF YOUR OWN ANNAL SOLLMN ARE AM YOURURE CHILDREN STORY
2961-961-0012 FOR IN THE TIMES BEFORE A GREAT FLOOD AFINGS WAS THE GREATEST AND BAST OF CITIES AND DEAD THE NOBLELESS DEEDS AND HAD THE BEST CONSTITUTION OF ANY UNDER DE FAHACE OF HEAVEN
2961-961-0013 SOLEMN MARVELLED AND DESIRE TO BE FORMED OF THE PARTICULARS
2961-961-0014 NINE THOUSAND YEARS HAVE YOU LAGED SINCE SHE FOUNDED YOURS AN EIGHT THOUSAND SINCE YOU FOUNDED OURRS AS OUR ANALS RECORT
2961-961-0015 MANY LAWS EXIST A ALL US WHICH ARE THE COUNTER PART OFEW WORSE AS THEY WERE IN THE OLDEN TIME
2961-961-0016 I WERE BRIEFLY DESCRIBEM TO YOU IN AAL READ THE ACCOUNT OF THEM AT YOUR LEISURE IN THE SACRED REGISTERS
2961-961-0017 OBSERV AGAIN WHAT CAREED ALOCK TOOK INTO PURSUIT OF WISDOM SEARCHING OUT THE DEEP THINGS OF THE WORLD AND APPLYING THEM TO THEVESE OF MEN
2961-961-0018 THE MOST VEMEES OF THEM ALL WAS THE OVERTHROW OF THE ISLAND OF A TWRANTS
2961-961-0019 FOR AT THE PERIL OF HER OWN EXISTENCE AND WHEN THE UTTER HAALINGS HAD DESERTED HER SHE REPELLEDING FAADER AND OF HER OWN ACCORD GAVE LIBERTY TO ALL THE NATIONS WITHINDEPILLARS
2961-961-0020 THIS IS THE EXPLANATION OF THE SHALLOWS WHICH HAVE FOUND IN THAT PART OF THE ATPLENTIC OCEAN
2961-961-0021 BUT I WOULD NOT SPEAK AT THE TIME BECAUSE I WANTED TO REFRESH LA MY MEMORY
2961-961-0022 THEN NOWOU LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU THE ORDER OF OUR ENTERTAINMENT FIRST TO ME US WAS A NATURAL PHILSPHER WILL SPEAK OF THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD GOING DOWN TO THE CREATION OF MEN AND THEN IALL RECEIVE THE MEN WHOM HE HAS CREATED AND SOME OF WHOM WILL HAVE BEEN EDUCATED BY YOU AND INTRODUCE THEM TO YOU AS THE LOST THE FEDIAN CITIZENS OF FROM THEGPI RECORD SPOKE
3570-5694-0000 BUT ALREADY AT A POINTED ECONOM AIC CAVOLUTION FAR AND STATING THE EMOGENCE OF THE LADY SPECIALIZED CONSEMPTTION OF A GOODS AS AN EVIDENCE OF PECUNAR' STRENGTH HAD BEGUN TO WORK OUT IN A MORALLESSLEBERATE SYSTEM
3570-5694-0001 THE UTILITYIVE CONSEMPTION AS AN EVIDENCE OF WEALTH IS TO BE CALASSED AS A DERIVATIVE GROWTH
3570-5694-0002 SUCH CONSUMPTION AS FULLS THROUGH TO THE WOMEN IS MEALLY INCIDENTAL TO THEIR WORK IT IS A MEANS TO THEIR CONTINUED LABOR AND NOT A CONSEMPTION DIRRECTED TO THEIR OWN CONFIT AND  FULLNESS OF LIFE
3570-5694-0003 WITH THE FURTHER ATDVS AND CULTURE THISABLOMATE CHANGE IN SIMPLE CUSTOM OF A MORA LESS RIGOROAS CHARACTER BUT WOULDVER BE THE THEURATICAL BASIS OF THE DISTINCTION WHICH IS MAINTAINED WHETHER IT BE AABU OR A LAR OF COMVENTIONALITY THE FEATURES OF THE CONVENTIONAL SCHEME OF CONSUMPTION DO NOT CHANGE EASILY
3570-5694-0004 IN THE NATURE OF THINGS LUXURIES AND THE CONFITS OF LIFE BLUNGED TO THE LEISURE CSS
3570-5694-0005 UNDER THE TABV SU IN VICTALS AND MOIC CARLY CERTAIN BEVERAGES ARE STRICTLY RESERVED FOR THE USE OF THE SUPERI CSSE
3570-5694-0006 DRANKNESS AND THE OTHER PTHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE FREE EARS OF STEMALS THEY HAVE ATTEND IN THEIR TN TO BECOME UNDERRIFIC AS BEING EMMAR AT THE SECOND REMOVE OF THE SUPERIIOUS STATEUS OF THOSE WHO AREABLE TO AFFORD THE INDULGENCE
3570-5694-0007 IT HAS EVEN HAPPENED THAT THE NAME FOR CERTAIN DISEASED CONDITIONS OF THE BODY ARISING FROM SUCH AN A ORIGIN HAS PASSED INTO EVERYDAY SPEECH AS A SN ANDEM FOR NOBLE OR GENTLE
3570-5694-0008 THE CONSUMPTION OF LEXURIES IN THE TRUSS HIS A CONSEMPTION DIRECTED TO THE CONFIT OF THE CONSUMUR HIMSELF AND IS THEREFORE AMRK OF THE MOSTER
3570-5694-0009 WITH MANY QUALIFIICATIONS WITH MORE QUALIFICATIONS AS THE PATRIICAL TRADITION HAS GRADAL WEAKENED THE GENERAL RU IS FELL TO BE RIGHT AND BINDING THAT WOMEN SHOULD CON SEEM ONLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEIR MOSTERS
3570-5694-0010 THE OBJECTION OF COURSE PRESENT ITSELF THAT EXPENDITURE ON WOMEN'S DRESS AND HOUSEHOLD PRAFNALIA IS AN OBVIOUS EXCEPTION TO THIS RUE BUT IT WILL APPEAR IN THE SEQUENT THAT THIS EXCEPTION IS MUCH MORE OBVIOUS AND SUBSTENTIAL
3570-5694-0011 THE CUSTOM OF FESTIVE GATHERINGS PROBABLY ORIGINATED IN MUTIVES OF COMVIALITY AND RELIGION THESE MOTIVE SERLS OF PRESENT IN THE LAT DEVELOPMENT THAT THEY DO NOT CONTINUER TO BE THE SOLE MOTIVES
3570-5694-0012 THERE IS A MORALIST AND LABORATE SYSTEM OF RANKING GREATATES
3570-5694-0013 THIS DIFFERENTIATION IS FURD THAT BY THE INHERITANCE OF WEALTH AND THE CONSEQUENT INHERITS OF GENTILITY
3570-5694-0014 MANY OF THESE OFFILIATE GENTLEMEN OF LEISURE ARE THE SAME TIME MESMEN OF SUBSTANCE IN THE OWN RIGHT SO THAT SOME OF THEM MUSCUSE ATLE OTHERS ONLY PASILY TO BERITED AS MY CHARIOUS CONSUMUS
3570-5694-0015 SO MANY OF THEM HOWEVER AS MAKE UP THE RETAINER AND HANGERSONE OF THE PATRON MAY BE CAUSE AS BY KARIOUS CONSUMUR WITHOUT QUALIFICATION
3570-5694-0016 MANY OF THESE AGAIN AND ALSO MANY OF THE OTHER ASTROCRACY OF LIST DEGREE HAVING TURN ATTAUCHED TO THE PERSONS A MOR LESS'S COMPREHENSIVE GROUP OF KERAUS CONSUMA IN THE PERSONS OF THEIR WIF'S AND CHILDREN THEIR SERVANTS RETAINERS ET CETERA
3570-5694-0017 THE WEARING OF UNIFORM'S ARE LIVER' IMPLIES A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF DEPENDENCE AND MAY AND BE SAID TO BE A MAC OF SAERVITUDE REAL AREISTENSIBLE
3570-5694-0018 THE WARES OF UNIFORMS AND LIVERIES MAY BE ROUGHILY DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES THE FREE AND THE SURVILE OR THE NOBLE AND THE IGNOLE
3570-5694-0019 BUT THE JOERAL DISTINCTION IS NOT E THAT ACCOUNT TO BE OVERLPED
3570-5694-0020 SO THOSE OFPFICIS WHICH ARE BY RIGHT THE PREPAR EMPLOYMENT OF THE LEISURE CLASS UN NOBLE SUCH AS GOVERNMENT FIGHTING HUNTING THE CARE OF ARMS AND ECQUTRMENTS AND THE LIKEE IN SHORT THOSE WHICH MAY BE CLASS AS OSTENSILY PREIARY EMPLOYMENTS
3570-5694-0021 WHENEVER AS IN THESE CASES THE MENEIAL SERVICE IN QUESTION HAS TODRECTLY WITH A PRIME RELIISURE EMPLOYMENTS OF FIGHTING AND HUNTING IT EASILY ACQUIISE OR REFECTED ON ARIFIC CHARACTER
3570-5694-0022 THE LIVERY BECOMES OBNUXIOUS TO EEALLY ALL WHO ARE REQUIRED TO WEAR IT
3570-5695-0000 IN A GENERAL WAY THOUGHO NOT WHOLLY NO CONSISTENTLY THEIES TWO GROUP'S COIN SIGHT
3570-5695-0001 THE DEPENDENT TO WAS FIRST DELEGATEED FOR THESE DUTUS WAS THE WIFE OR THE CHIEF WIFE AND AS WOULD BE EXPECTED IN E LATED DEVEOLOPMENT OF THE INSTITUTION WHEN THE NUMBER OF PERSONS BY WHOM THESE DUTES ARECHUSMOMARILY PERFORMED GRADUULAL AND NARROWS THE WIFE REMAINS THE LOST
3570-5695-0002 BUT US WE DESCEND THE SOCIAL SCALE THE POINT IS PRESENTLY REACHED WITH THE DUTIES OFY KARERAUS LEISURE AND CONSUEMPTION DEVOLVE UPON THE WIFE ALONE
3570-5695-0003 IN THE COMMUNITIES OF THE WESON CULTURE THIS POINT AS OF PRESENT FOUND AMONG THE LOWERID OF CLASS
3570-5695-0004 IF BEAUTURE COMFID IS ACHIEVED AND IT ISM MORIALIST FOR TRE TO CIRCUMSTANANCE IF THERE THEY MUST BECHIEVED BY MEANS AND METHODS THAT COMMEND THEMSELVES TO THE GREAT ECONOMIC LAW ORFVOICED EFFORT
3570-5695-0005 THE MAN OF THE HOUSEHOLD ALSO CAN DO SOMETHING IN THIS THEREICTION NO AND INDEED HE COMMONLY DOES BUT WITH A STILL LOWER DESCEND INTO THE LEVELS OF INDIGENCE ALONG THE MARGIN OF THE SLIMS THE MAN AND PRESENTLY ALSO THE CHILDREN VIRTUALLY IS SEIASED TO CONCEUME VALUABLE GOODS FOR APPEARANCES AND THE WOMAN REMAINS VIRTUALLY THE SOLE EXPONENT OF THE HOUSEHOLDS PECUNARY DECENCY
3570-5695-0006 VERY RI MUCH OF SQUALER AND DISCOMFIT WILL BE ENDEURED BEFORE THE LAST TRINKET OR THE LAST PRETENENCE OF PECUNARY DECENCIES PUT AWAY
3570-5695-0007 THERE IS NO CLASS AND NO COUNTRY THAT AS YIELD SO OBJECTLY BEFORE THE PRESSURE OF PHYSICAL WANTT AS TO DENY THEMSELVES ALL GRATIFICATION OF THIS HIGHER OR SPRITIL NEED
3570-5695-0008 THE QUESTIONNESS WHICH OF THE TWO METHODS WILL MOST EFFECTIVELY REACH THE PERSONS WHOSE CONVICTIONS IT IS DESIRE TO EFFECT
3570-5695-0009 EACH WILL THERE FOR SERVE ABOUT EQUALLY WELL DOING THE EARNEER STAGES OF SOCIAL GROWTH
3570-5695-0010 THE MUTHERDIN ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY WORKS IN THE SAME DIRECTION ALSO VI ANOTHER LINE
3570-5695-0011 IT IS EVIDENT THEREFOR THAT THE PRESENT TREND OF THE DEVELOPMENT IS IN THAT ARECTION OF H HEIGHTENING UTILITYIVE CONSPICUIOUS CONCEMPTION AS COMPARED WITH LEISURE
3570-5695-0012 IT IS ALSOICPL THAT THE SOVCIBILITIVE CONSEMPTION AS A MEANS OF REPUTE AS WELL AS THE INSISTANCE ON IT AS AN ELEMENT OF DECENCY IS THAT IT SPST IN THOSE PORTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY WITH HUMAN CONTCT OF THE INDIVIDUALLYIES WIDEST AND THE MABILITY OF THE POPULATION IS GREATEST
3570-5695-0013 CONSUMPTION BECOMES A LARGE ELEMENT IN THISANDARD OF LIVING IN THE CITY THAN IN THE COUNTRY
3570-5695-0014 AMONG THE COUNTRY PREPULATION ITS PLACES TO SOME EXTENT TAKEN BY SAVINGS AND HOME CONFORT S KNOWOWN THROUGH THE MEDUM OF NEIGHBOURH GOSIP SUFFICIENTLY TO SERVE THE LIKE GENERAL PPS OF PECUNARY REPUTE
3570-5695-0015 THE RESOLVT IS A GREAT MALABILITY OF THE LABOUR EMPLOYEDING PRINTING PPS GREATER THAN IN ANY OTHER EQUALLY WELLY FINE AND CONSIDERABLE BDY OF WORKMEN
3570-5696-0000 UNDER THE SAIMPLE TEST OF EFFECTIVENESS FOR ADVERTISING WE SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND LEISURE AND THE CONSPICUIOUS CONSUMPTION OF GOODS DIVIDING THE FIELD OF PECUNARY AMLATION PRETTY EVENLY BETWEEN THEM AT THE OUTSET
3570-5696-0001 BUT THE ACTUAL COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THIS IDEAL SCHEME LEISURE HELD THE FIRST PLACE AT THE START AND CAME TOL THE RANK FAIRMA ABOVE VISTEFUL CONCEUMPTION OF GOODS BOTH AS A DICT EXPOONENT OFWALTH AND DOZEN ELEMENT IN THE STANDARD OF DECENCY DURING THE COURSE I PIEACEFUL CULTURE
3570-5696-0002 ARE THE CIRCUMSTANCE PMITTING THAT INSTINCT DISPOSES MEN TO LOOK WITH FAVOUR UPON PRODUCTIVE EFFICIENCY AND ONMALDEAVERUR IS OF HUMANS
3570-5696-0003 A RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE TWO CONFICING REQUIRANCE IS AFFECTED BY RESORT TO MAKE BELIEVE ME MAN AND INTRICATE POLITE OBSERVANCES AND SOCIAL DUE TO C OF AS CEREMON AND NATURE ARE DEVELOPED MANY ORGANIZATIONS HAVEF HOUND WITH SOME SPECIOUS OBJECT OF AMILARATION ANDMDDED IN THEIR OFFICIAL STLENT TIGHTLE THERE IS MUCH COMING AND GOING AND A DEAL OF TOK TO THE END THAT THE TOALK IS MAY NOT HAV OICATION TO REFLECT ON WHAT IS THE EFFECTUAL ECONOMIC VALUE OF THEIR TRAFFIC
3570-5696-0004 THE SAIL AND FEATURES OF THESE DEVELOPMENT OF DOMESTIC SERVICE HAVE ALREAD DIIN INDICATED
3570-5696-0005 THROUGHOUT THE ENTIREVOLUTION OF CONSPICIOUS EXPENDITURE WHETHER OF GOOD SOR OF SERVICES OR HUMAN LIFE REUNS THE OBVIOUS IMPLICATION THAT IN ORDER TO EFFECTUALLY MEND THE CONSUME IS GOOD FAME IT MUST BE AN EXPENDITURE OF SUPERFLUITIES
3570-5696-0006 AS USE IN THE SPECH OF EVERYDAY LIFE THE WORD CARRIESON UNDER TONE OF THEPRECATION
3570-5696-0007 THE US OF THE WORD WASTE DO AS A TECHNICLE TERM THEREFORE IMPRISE NO DEPPRECATION OF THE MOTIVES OR OF THE ENSSOUGHULT BY THE CONSTSUMUR UNDER THIS CANNON OF CONSPICUOIOUS WTE
3570-5696-0008 BUT IT IS ANOTHER GROUNDS WORTH NOTING THAT THE TO WASTE IN THE LANGUAGE OFVER DAYAY LIFE IMPLIESED DEPRECATION OF WHAT DISCHRACTTERIZ AS WISTEFUL
3570-5696-0009 HE STRICT ACCURACY NOTHING SHOULD BE INCLUDED UNDER THE HEAD OF CONSPICUS WASTE BUT SUCH EXPENDITURE AS HIS INCOURED ON THE GROUND OF AN INVIGIOUS PECUNARY COMPARISON
3570-5696-0010 ANOUGHTICAL MAY BE USEFUL AND WISTFUL BOTH AND IT CTILITY TO THE CONSIUR MAY BE MADE UP OF USE AND WASTE IN THE MOST VAING PROPORTIONS
3575-170457-0000 AND OFTEN HAS MY MOTHER SAID WHILE ON HER LAP I LAID MY HEAD SHE FEARED FOR TIME I WAS NOT MADE BUT FREETERNITY
3575-170457-0001 WH WHERE WE TO BE DENIED EACH OTHER SOCIETY
3575-170457-0002 WHY WE TO BE DIVIDING
3575-170457-0003 SURELY IT MUST BE BECAUSE WE IN DANGER OF LOVING EACH OTHER TOO WELL OF LOSING SIGHT OF THE CREATOR IN IDLETRYE OF THE CREATURE
3575-170457-0004 WE US TO DISPUTE ABOUT POTICS AND RELIGION
3575-170457-0005 SHEATORIAN CLERTYMAN'S DAUGHTER WAS ALWAYS IN A MINORITY OF ONE IN HERTH OF VIOLENT DESCENT IN RAATICALISM
3575-170457-0006 HER FEEBLE HEALTH GVE HER HER YIELDING MANNER FOR SHE COULD NEVER OPPOSE ANY ONE WITHOUT GATHERING UP ALL HER STRENGTH FOR THE STRUGGLE
3575-170457-0007 HE SPOKE FRENCH PERFECTLY I HAVE BEEN TOLD WHEN NEED WAS BUT DELIGHTED USUALLY AND TALKING THE BROADESTYORCHSHERE
3575-170457-0008 AND SO LIFE AND DEATH HAVE DISPERSED THE CIRCLE A VIOLENT RADICLES AND DISSENTRES INTO WHICH TWENTY YEARS AGO THE LITTLE QUIET RESOLUTE CLERGYMAN'S DAUGHTER WAS RECEIVED AND BY WHOM SHE WAS TRULY LOVED AN HONOORED
3575-170457-0009 JANUARY AND FEBRUARY OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN HAD PASSED AWAY AND STILL THERE WAS NO REPLY FROM THE CLTHIE

3575-170457-0011 BUT IT IS NOT WITH A VIEW TO DISTINCTION THAT YOU SHOULD CULTIVATE THIS TALENT IF YOU CANSIDEW YOUR UNHAPPINESS
3575-170457-0012 YOU WILL SAY THAT A WOMAN HAS NO NEED OF SUCH A CAUTION THERE CAN BE NO PERIL IN IT FOR HER
3575-170457-0013 THE MORE SHE IS ENGAGED IN HER PROPER DUTIES THE LALESS LEISURE WH WILLIL SHE HAVE FOR IT EVEN AS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT AND A RECREATION
3575-170457-0014 TO THOSE DUTIES YOU HAVE NOT YET BEEN CALLED AND WHEN YOU ARE YOU WILL BE LESS EAGER FOR CLEBERTY

3575-170457-0039 THE CRRISMAS HOLIDAYS CAME AND SHE AND AN RETURNED TO THE PARSONAGE AND TO THAT HAPPY HOME CIRCLE IN WHICH ALONE THEIR NATURE'S EXPANDED AMONGST ALL OTHER PEOPLE THEY SHRIVELED THAT MORE OR LESS
3575-170457-0040 INDEED THERE WERE ONLY ONE OR TO STRANGERS WHO COULD BE ADMITTED AMONG THE SISTERS WITHOUT PRODUCING THE SAME RESULT
3575-170457-0041 SHE WAS GONE OUT INTO THE VILLAGE ON SOME ERR ANDD WHEN AS SHE WAS DESCENDING THE STEEP STREET HER FOOT SLIPPED ON ICE AND SHE FELL HE WAS DARKEN NO ONE SAW HER MISSCHANCE TILL AFTER A TIME HER GROANS ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF A PASSOR BY

3575-170457-0044 AFTER THIS DISAPPOINTMENT I NEVER DARE RCKING WITH CERTAINTEA ON THE ENJOYMENT OF A PLEASURE AGAIN IT SEEMS AS IF SOME FATALITY STOOD BETWEEN YOU AND ME
3575-170457-0045 I AM NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU AND YOU MUST BE KEPT FROM THE CONTAMINATION OF TWO INTIMATE SOCIETY
3575-170457-0046 A GOOD NEIGHBOUR OF THE BRONANTTES A CLEVER INTELLIGENT YORKSHER WOMAN WHO KEEPS A DRUGG A SHOP AND HAWWORTH AND FROM OCCUPATION HER EXPERIENCE IN EXCELLENT SENS HOLDS THE POSITION OF VILLAGE DOTRESS IN NURSE AND AS SUCH HAS BEEN A FRIEND IN MANY A TIME OF TRIAL AND SICKINESS AND DEATH IN THE HOUSEHOLDD ROUND TOLD ME A CHARACISTCK LITTLE INCIDENT CONNECTED WITH TABBEY'SFRACTURED LEG
3575-170457-0047 TABBY HAD LIVED WITH THEM FOR TEN OR TWELVE YEARS AND WAS AS CHARLOTTE EXPRESSED IT ONE OF THE FAMILY
3575-170457-0048 HE REFUSE AT FIRST TO LISTEN TO THE CAREFUL ADVICE IT WAS REPUGNENT TO HIS LIBERAL NATURE
3575-170457-0049 THIS DECISION WAS COMMUNICATED TO THE GIRLS
3575-170457-0050 TABB HADTENDED THEM IN THEIR TILDHOOD THEY AND NONETHER SHE TEND HER IN HER INFIRMITY AND AGE
3575-170457-0051 AT TEA TIME THEY WERE SAD AND SILENT AND THE MEAL WENT TOWAY UN TOOUCHED BY ANY OF THE THREE
3575-170457-0052 SHE HAD ANOTHER WAYIGHT ON HER MIND THIS CHRISTMAS
3575-170457-0053 BUT ANNE HAD BEGUN TO SUVERF HER DOUS BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS AND CHARLOTTE WATCHED OVER HER YOUNGER SISTERS WITH THE JEALOUS VIGILENCE OF SOME WILD CREATURE THAT CHANGES HER VERY NATURE IF DANGER THREATENEDS HER YOUNG
3575-170457-0054 STUNG MY ANXIETY FOR THIS LITTLE SISTER SHE UPBRAATED MISS WU FOR HER FANCIED INDIFFERENCE AND STATE OF HEALTH
3575-170457-0055 STILL HER HEART HAD RECEIVED A SHOCK IN THE PERCEPTION OF ANNE'S DELICACY AND ALL THESE HOLIDAY SHE WATCHED OVER HER WITH THE LONGING FONDXIETY WHICH IS SOLE FULL OF SUDDEN PINGS OF FEAR
3575-170457-0056 I DOU'T WHETHER BROWN WELL WAS MAINTAINING HIMSELF AT TIME
3729-6852-0000 TO CELEBRATE THE ARRIVAL OF HER SON SYLVIA GAVE A SPLENDID SUPPER TO WHICH SHE HAD INVITED ALL HER RELATIVES AND IT WAS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO MAKE THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
3729-6852-0001 WITHOUT SAYING IT POSITIVELY SHE MADE ME UNDERSTAND THAT BEING HERSELF AN ILLUSTRIOUS MEMBER OF THE REPUBLIC OF LETTERS SHE WAS WELL AWARE THAT SHE WAS SPEAKING TO AN INSECT
3729-6852-0002 IN ORDER TO PLEASE HER I SPOKE TO HER OF THE ABBECANTI AND I HAD OCCASION TO QUOTE TWO LINES OF THAT PROFOUND WRITER
3729-6852-0003 MADAME CORRECTED ME WITH A PATRONIZING AIR FOR MYPNUNCIATION OF THE WORD SCOVERYA WHICH MEANS DIVIDED SAYING THAT IT OUGHT TO BE PRONOUNCED SCURA AND SHE ADDED THAT I OUGHT TO BE VERY GLAD TO HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH ON THE FIRST DAY OF MY ARRIVAL IN PARIS TELLING ME THAT IT WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT DAY IN MY LIFE
3729-6852-0004 HER FACE WAS AN ENIGMAH INSPIRED EVERY ONE WITH THE WARMEST SYMPATHY AND YET IF YOU EXAMIN IT ATTENTIVELY THERE WAS NOT ONE BEAUTIFUL FEATURE SHE COULD NOT BE CALLED HANDSOME BUT NO ONE COULD HAVE THOUGHT HER UGLY
3729-6852-0005 SYLVIA WAS THE ADTERATION OF FRANCE AND HER TALENT WAS THE REAL SUPPORT OF ALL THE COMMDIES WHICH THE GREATEST AUTHORS WROTE FOR HER ESPECIALLY OF THE PLAYS OF MARIVO FOR WITHOUT HER HIS COMMOEDDIES WOULD NEVER HAVE GONE TO PROSTTERITY
3729-6852-0006 SYLVIA DID NOT THINK THAT HER GOOD CONDUCT WAS A MERIT FOR SHE KNEW THAT SHE WAS VIRTUOUS ONLY BECAUSE HERSELF LOVE COMPELLED HER TO BE SO AND SHE NEVER EXHIBITED ANY PRIDE OR ASSUMED ANY SU PERIORITY TOWARD T HERTH THEIATRICAL SISTERS ALL THOSE SATISFIED TO SHINE BY THEIR TALENT OR THEIR BEAUTY THEY CARED LITTLE ABOUT RENDERING THEMSELVES CONSPICUOUS BY THEIR VIRTUE
3729-6852-0007 TWO YEARS BEFORE HER DEATH I SAW HER PERFORM THE CHARACTER OF MARRIANNE IN THE COMITY OF MARAVA AN IN SPITE OF HER AGE AND DECLINING HEALTH THE ILLUSION WAS COMPLETE
3729-6852-0008 SHE WAS HONOORURABLY BURIED IN THE CHURCH OF SAINT SO OFVERAIR WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST OPPOSITION FROM THE VENERABLE PRIEST WHO FAR FROM SHARING THE ANTI CHRISTIAN INTOLERANCY OF THE CLERGY IN GENERAL SAID THAT HER PROFESSION AS AN ACTRESS HAD NOT HINDERED HER FROM BEING A GOOD CHRISTIAN AND THAT THE EARTH WAS A COMMON MOOTHER OF ALL HUMAN BEINGS AS JESUS CHRIST HAD BEEN THE SAVIOUR OF ALL MANKIND
3729-6852-0009 YOU WILL FORGIVE ME DEAR READER IF I HAVE MADE YOU ATTEND THE FUNERAL OF SYLVIA TEN YEARS BEFORE HER DEATH BELIEVE ME I HAVE NO INTENTION OF PERFORMING A MIRACAL YOU MAY CONSLE YOURSELF WITH THE IDEA THAT I SHALL SPARE YOU THAT UNPLEASANT TASK WHEN POOR SYLVIADES
3729-6852-0010 I NEVER HAD ANY FAMILY

3729-6852-0045 HE HAD A GOOD APPETITE COULDITELL A GOOD STORY WITHOUT LAUGHING WAS CELEBRATED FOR HIS WODY REPARTES IN HIS SOCIABLE MANNERS BUT HE SPENT HIS LIFE AT HOME SELDOM GOING OUT AND SEEING HARDLY ANY ONE BECAUSE HE ALWAYS HAD A PIPE IN HIS MOUTH AND WAS SURROUNDED BY AT LEAST TWENTY CATS WITH WHICH HE WOULD AMUSE HIMSELF ALL DAY
3729-6852-0046 HIS HOUSEKEEPER HAD THE MANAGEMENT OF EVERYTHING SHE NEVER ALLOWED HIM TO BE IN NEED OF ANYTHING AND SHE GAVE NO ACCOUNT OF HIS MONEY WHICH SHE KEPT ALTOGETHER BECAUSE HE NEVER ASKED HER TO RENDER ANY ACCOUNTS
4077-13751-0000 ON THE SIXTH OF APRIL EIGHTEEN THIRTY THEIR CHURCH OF ESUS CHRIST OF LATTERD E SAINTS WAS FORMERLY ORGANIZED AND THUS TOOK ON A LEGAL EXISTENCE
4077-13751-0001 ITS ORIGIN WAS SMALL ADJERM AND INSIGNIFICANT SED HARDLY TO BE THOUGHT OF AS LIKELY TO AROUS OPPOSITION
4077-13751-0002 INSTEAD OF BUT SIX REGULARLY AFILIATED MEMBERS AND AT MOST TO SCORE OF ADHERENTS THE ORGANIZATION NUMBERS TO DAY MANY HUNDRED THOUSAND SOULS
4077-13751-0003 IN PLACE OF A SINGLE HAMLET IN THE SMALLEST CORNER OF WHICH THE MEMBERS COULD HAVE CONGREIGATED THERE NOW ARE ABOUT SEVENTY STAKES OFZCAN AND ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED ORGANIZED WORDS EACH WARD AND STAKE WITH ITS  FULL COMPLIMENT OF OFFICERS AND PRESTED ORGANIZATIONS
4077-13751-0004 THE PRACTICE OF GATHERING ITS PROSOLITS INTO ONE PLACE PREVENTCED THE BUILING UP AND STRENGTHENING OF FOREIGN BRANCHES AND INASMUCH IS EXTENSIVE AND STRONG ORGANIZATIONS ARE SELDOMT WITH ABROAD VERY I ERRONOIOUS IDEAS EXIST CONCERNING THE STRENGTH OF THE CHURCH
4077-13751-0005 NEVERTHELESS OF THE MUSTERD SEAT AMONG THE SMALLEST OF ALL SEEEATS HAS ATTAIN THE PROPORTIONS OF A TREE AND THE BIRDS OF THE AIR ARE NESTING IN ITS BRANCHES THE ACORD IS NOW IN OAK OFFERING PROTECTION AND THE SWEETS OF SATISFACTION TO EVERY EARNEST PILGRIM JOURNEING ITS WAY FER TRUTH
4077-13751-0006 THEIR EYES WERE FROM THE FIRST TURNED IN ANTICIPATION TOWARD THE EVENING SON NOT MERELY THAT THE WORK OF PROSOLATING SHOULD BE CARRIED ON IN THE WEST BUT THE THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE CHURCH SHOULD BE THERE ESTABLISHED
4077-13751-0007 THE BOOKLEMRMMENT HAD TAUGHT THE PEOPLE THE TRUE ORIGIN AND DESTINY OF THE AMERICAN INDIANS AND TO WOR THIS DARK SKINED REMNANT OF A ONCE MIGHTY PEOPLE THE MISSIONARIES OF MOMANISM EARLY TURNED THEIR EYES AND WITH THEIR EYES WENTED THEIR HEARTS AND THEIR HOPES
4077-13751-0008 IT IS NOTABLE THAT THE INDIAN TRIBES HAVE DEARLY REGARDED THEIR RELIGION OF THE LATTER DAYYS SAINT WITH FAVOR SEEING IN THE BOOKAL WARMON STRIKING AGREEMENT WITH HER OWN TRADITIONS
4077-13751-0009 THE FIRST WELL ESTABLISHED SEAT OF THE CHURCH WAS IN THE PRETTY LITTLE TOWN OF CURLLAND OHIO ALMOST WITHIN SIGHT OF LAKE ERIE AND HERE SOON ROSE THE FIRST TEMPLE OF MODERN TIMES
4077-13751-0010 TO THE FERVENT LATTER DAY A SAINT A TEMPLE IS NOT SIMPLY A CHURCH BUILDING A HOUSE FOR A RELIGIOUS ASSEMBLY
4077-13751-0011 SOON THOUSANDS OF COVERTS HAD REENTED OR PURCHASED HOMES OF MISEE INDEPENDS JACKS AND COUNTY BEING THEIR CENTER BUT FROM THE FIRST THEY WERE UNPOPULAR AMONG THE MISURIANS
4077-13751-0012 THE LUEUTENANT GOVERNOR LITTLE BURN W BOGS AFTERWARD GOVERNOR WAS A PRONOUNCED WARMAN HATER AND THOUT THE PERIOD OF THE TROUBLES HE ME IF AS IS SYMPATHY WITH THE PERSECS
4077-13751-0013 THEIR SUFFERINGS HAVE NEVERY HAVE BEEN FITLY CHRONICL BY HUEMAN SCRIBE
4077-13751-0014 MAKING THEIR WAY ACROSS THE RIVER MOST OF THE REFUGEIES FOUND SHELTER AMONG THE MORE HOSPITABLE PEOPLE OF CLAY COUNY AND AFTERWARD ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES IN CALLED WELLE COUNTY THERE IN FOUING THE CITY OF FAR WEST
4077-13751-0015 A SMALL SETTLEMENT HAD BEEN FOUNDED BY WRMAN SAMILIES ON SHAL CREEK AND HERE ON THE THIRTEIES OF OCTOBER EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT A COMPANY OF TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FELL UPON THE HAPLESS SETTLERS AND WHICHCHERED ESCORE
4077-13751-0016 BE IT SAID TO THE HONOOR OF SOME OF THE OFFICERS INENTRUSTED WITH A TERRIBLE COMMISSION THAT WHEN THEY LEARNED ITS TRUE SIGNIFICANCE THEY RESIGNED THEIR AUTHORITY RATHER THAN HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT THEY DESIGNATED A COLD BLOODED BUTCHERY
4077-13751-0017 OH WOULD A RECORD TO READ WHAT A PICTUR THE GAZE UPON HOW AWFFUL THE FACT
4077-13751-0018 AMERICAN SCHOOLBOYS READ WITH EMOTIONS OF HORROR OF THE ALBGENCES DRIVEN BEATEN AND KILLED WITH A PAPPLE LEGATE DIRECTING THE BUTCHERY AND OF TH THE DOIS HUNTED ANDCUNDED LIKE BEASTS AS THE EFFECT OF A ROYAL DETREE AND THEY YET SHALL READ IN THE HISTORY OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY OF SCENES AS TERRIBLE AS THESE IN THE EXHIBITION OF INJUSTICE AND INHUMAN HATE
4077-13751-0019 WHO BEGAN THE QUARREL WAS AT THE MORMANS
4077-13751-0020 AS THE SAABLE OF THE PRESS COMMENTS AGAINST OF THE BRUTALITY OF THE MASUERIIANS I QUOTE A PARAGRAPH FROM THE QUINCIY ARGUS MARCH SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE
4077-13751-0021 IT WILL BE OBSERVED THAT AN ORGANIZED MOB AIDED BY MANY OF THE CIVIL AND MILITARY OFFICERS OF MISUERI WITH GOVERNOR BOX AT THEIR HEAD HAVE BEEN THE PROMINENT ACTORS IN THIS BUSINESS IN CIGHTY TOO IT APPEARS AGAINST THE WARMONS BY POLITICAL HATRED AND BY THE ADDITIONAL MOTIVE OF PLUNDER AND REVENGE
4077-13754-0000 THE ARMY SOUND THE PEOPLE AND HOVERTY AND LEFT THEM IN COMPARATIVE WEALTH
4077-13754-0001 BUT A WORD FURTHER CONCERNING THE EXPEDITION IN GENERAL
4077-13754-0002 IT WAS THROUGH FLOIDS ADVICE THAT BECATENT ORDER TO THE MILITARY EXPEDITION TO UTAH HOSTENSIBLY TO INSTLL CERTAIN FEDERAL OFFICIALS AND TO REPRESS AN LEGED INFANTAL REBELLION WHICH IN FACT HAD NEVER COME INTO EXISTENCE BUT IN REALITY TO FURTHER THE ENTRANCE OF THE SUSSESSIONISTS
4077-13754-0003 MOREOVERE HAD THE PEOPLE BEEN INCLINED TO REBELLION WHILE GREAT HER OPPORTUNITY COULD THEY HAVE WISHED
4077-13754-0004 ALREADY AND NORTH A SOUTH WERE TALK IT OF WY NOT SAID A BOST A WEST
4077-13754-0005 THEY KNEW NO NORTH NO SOUTH NO EAST NO WEST THEY SOOT POSITIVELY BY THE CONSTITUTION AND WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO IN THE BLOODY STRIFE BETWEEN BROTHERS UNLESS INDEED THEY WERE SUMMONED BY THE AUTHORITY TOO WHICH THEY HAD ALREADY ONCE LOYALLY RESPONDED TO FURNISH MEN AND ARMS FOR THE COUNTRY'ESS NEED
4077-13754-0006 WHAT THE LETTERY SAINTS CALLSILLLESIAL MARRIAGE HIS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE CHURCH AND ISON VERY GENERAL PRACTICE BUT OF SOLESTIAL MARRIAGE PLORALITY OF WIVES WAS AN INCIDENT NEVER AN ESSENTIAL
4077-13754-0007 WE BELIEVE AAL RESURRECTION AND AN ACTUAL HEREA AFTER IN WHICH FUATURE STATE SHALL BE RECOGNIZED EVERY SAANCTIFIED AUTHORIZE RELATIONSHIP EXISTING HERE ON EARTH OF PARENT AND CHILD BROTHER IN'S SISTER HUSBAND AND WIFE
4077-13754-0008 IT HAS BEEN MY PRIVILEGE TO TREAD THE SOIL OF MANY LANDS TO OBSERVE THE CUSTOMS AND STUDY THE HABITS OF MORE NATIONS THAN ONE AND I HAVE YET TO FIND THE PLACE IN MEET THE PEOPLE WHEREIN WITH WHOM THE PURITY OF MAN AND WOMAN HAS HELD MORE PRECIOUS THAT AMONG THE MA ALLINED MORMANS IN THE MOUNTAIN VALLEYS OF THE WEST
4077-13754-0009 AT THE INCEPTION OF BORL MARRIAGE AMONG THE LATTER DAY SITS THERE WAS NO LAW NATIONAL OR STATE AGAINSTS PRACTICE
4077-13754-0010 IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO A LAW WAS AN NEACTY WITH A PURPOSE OF SUPPRESSING PORAL MARRIAGE AND AS HAD BEEN PREDICTED IN THE NATIONAL SENATE PRAYER TO ITS PASSAGE IT LAY FROM MANY YEARS A DEAD LETTER
4077-13754-0011 FEDERAL JUDGES UNITED STATES ATTORNES AND UTA WHO WERE NOT MORMANS NOR LOVERS OF WARMANISM REFUSE TO ENTERTAIN COMPLAINTS OR PROSEAICUIVEE CASES UNDER THE LAW BECAUSE OF ITS MANIFEST IN JUSTICE AND INADEQUCY
4077-13754-0012 THIS MEMENT THAT FOR AN ALLCH MISDEMEANOUR FROM WHICH CONGRESS PRESCRIBED A MAXIMIMPENALTY OF SIX MONTH'S IMPRISONMENT AND A FINE OF THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MAN MIGHT BE IMPRISON FOR LIFE I FOR MANY TERMS OF IMMS NATURAL LIFE DID THE COURTS POWER TO INFORCE IT SENTENCES EXTEND SO FAR AND MIGHT BE FIND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
4077-13754-0013 BEFORE THIS TRAVESTY ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF LAW COULD BE BROUGHT BEFORE THE COURT OF LAST RESORT AND THERE MET WITH THE REVERSAL AND REBUKE IT A DESERVED MEN WERE IMPRISONED UNDER SENTENCE OF MANY YEARS DURATION
4077-13754-0014 THE PEOPLE CONTESSITY THESE MEASURES ONE BY ONE IN THE COURTS PRESENTING IN CASE AFTER CASE THE DIFFERENT PCEES OF THE SUBJECT AND URGING THE UNCOUSITUTIONALITY OF THE MEASURE
4077-13754-0015 THE THAN THE CHURCH WAS DISINCRORPORATED AND ITS PROPERTABLE THE REAL AND PERSONAL CONFISCATED AND ASITIATED TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND ALTHOUGH THE PERSONAL PROPERTY WAS SOON RESTORED REALISTATE OF GREAT VALUE LONG LAY IN THE HANDS OF THE COURTS RECEIVER AND THE MORMAN CHURCH HAD TO PAY THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT HIGHENTAL ON ITS OWN PROPERTY
4077-13754-0016 AND SO THE STORY OF MORMANISM RUNS ON ITS FAINLLEY HAS NOT  HEY HAD BEEN WRITTEN THECRENT PRESS PRESENTS CONTINUOUSLY NEW STAGES OF ITS PROGRESS NEW DEVELOPMENTS OF ITS PLAN

5105-28233-0001 HE SEEMED BORN TO PLEASE WITHOUTINGCONSCIOUS OF THE POWER HE POSSESSED
5105-28233-0002 IT MUST BE OWNED AND NO ONE WAS MORE READY TO CONFESS IT THAN HIMSELF THAT HIS LITERARY ATTAINMENTS WERE BY NO MEANS OF A HIGH ORDER
5105-28233-0003 WE DON'T SPEND TOPS IS A FAVORITE SAYING AMONGST ARTILLERY OFFICERS INDICATING THAT THEY DO NOT SHIR THEIR DUTY BY FRIVOLOUS PURSUITS BUT IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT SERVANT THAT BEING NATURALLY IDLE WAS VERY MUCH GIVEN TO SPINDING TOPS
5105-28233-0004 ONCE AN ACTION HE WAS LEADING A ATTACHMENT OF INFANTRY THROUGH AN ENTRENCHMENT
5105-28233-0005 SOMETIMES HE WHO WOULD WANDER ON FOOT UPON THE SANDY SHORE AND SOMETIMES HE WOULD ENJOY A RID ALONG THE SUMMIT OF THE CLIFF ALTOGETHER BEING IN NO HURRY AT ALL TO BRING HIS TASK TO AN END
5105-28233-0006 NO CATHEDRAL NOT EVEN BURGOS ITSELF COULD VIE WITH A CHURCH AT MOUNTNRTRA
5105-28233-0007 BENZ OF MOST AMBITIOUS DESIRE WAS TO INDUCE THE CAPTAIN TO GO WITH HIM AND END HIS DAYS IN HIS MUCH LOVED HOME AND SO INCESSANTLY WERE SERVANTX EARS BESIEGED WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF THE UNPARLLLO BEAUTYIES AND ADVANTAGES OF THIS EIGHTEENTH OUR ON DESIMO OF PARIS THAT HE COULD SCARCELY HEAR THE NAME OF MONTMRCHRA WITHOUT A CONSCIOUS THRILL OF AVERSION
5105-28233-0008 WHEN A PRIVATE IN THE EIGHTH CAVALRY HE HAD BEEN ON THE POINT OF QUITTING THE ARMY AT TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OF AGE BUT UNEXPECTEDLY HE HAD BEEN APPOINTED ORDERLY TO CAPTAIN SERVANTEDCK
5105-28233-0009 THE BOOND OF UNION THUS EFFECTED COULD NEVER BE SEVERED AND ALTHOUGHNDZ OF ACHIEVEMENTS HAD FAIRLY EARNED HIM THE RIGHT OF RETIREMENT HE FIRMLY DECLIINED ALL HONORS OR ANY PENSION THAT MIGHT PART HIM FROM HIS SUPERIOR OFFICER
5105-28233-0010 A LIKE HIS MASTER HE MADE NO PRETENSTION TO ANY GIFT OF POETIC POWER BUT HIS INEXHAUSIBLE MEMORY MADE HIM A LIVING IN PSYCLAPEDIA AND FOR HIS STOCK OF ANECDOTES AND TROOPER' TALS HE WAS MATCHLESS
5105-28240-0000 FAST AS HIS LEGS COULD CARRY HIM SERV ACK HAD MADE HIS WAY TO THE TOP OF THE CLIFF
5105-28240-0001 IT WAS QUITE TRUE THAN A VESSEL WAS IN SIGHT HARDLY MORE THAN SIX MILES FROM THE SHORE BUT OWING TO THE INCREASE IN THE EARTH'S CONVEXITY AND THE CONSEQUENT LIMITATION OF THE RANGE OF VISION THE RIGING OF THE TOPT MASTSLONE WAS VISIBLE ABOVE THE WATER
5105-28240-0002 EXCLAIMED SERV ACK KEEPING HIS EYE UNMOVED AT HIS TEAL SCOPE
5105-28240-0003 SHE HAS UNDERSILED THAT SHE IS COUNT HIM ACHEFTS YAT HE WAS RIGHT
5105-28240-0004 IF THE COUNT WERE ON BOARD A STRANGE VITALITY WAS BRINGING HIM THE PRESENCE OF HIS RIVAL
5105-28240-0005 HE RECKON THEREFORE NOT ONLY UPON ASCERTAINING THE EXTENT OF THE LAKE CATASTROPHE BUT UPON LEARNING ITS CAUSE
5105-28240-0006 THE WIND BEING ADVERSE THE DOGREENA DID NOT MAKE VERY RAPID PROGRESS BUT AS THE WEATHER IN SPITE OF A FEW CLOUDS REMAINED CALM AND THE SEA WAS QUITE SMOOTH SHE WAS ENABLED TO HOLD A STEADY COURSE
5105-28240-0007 SERVIDCK TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT THEOR BRINA WAS ENDEAVORING TO PUT IN
5105-28240-0008 A NARROW CHANNEL FORMED A PASSAGE THROUGH THE RIDGE OF ROCKS THAT PROTECTED IT FROM THE OPEN SEA AND WHICH EVEN IN THE ROUGHEST WEATHER WOULD INSURE THE CALMNESS OF ITS WATERS
5105-28240-0009 SLIGHTLY CHANGING HER COURSE SHE FIRST STRUCK HER MAIN SAIL AND IN ORDER OF FACILITATE THE MOVEMENTS OF HER HEMSMAN SOON CARRIED NOTHING BUT HER TWO TOP SAILS BRIGANTINE AND JIBB
5105-28240-0010 CAPTAIN SERV A BACK HASTENED TOWARD HIM
5105-28240-0011 I LEFT YOU ON A CONTINENT AND HERE I HAVE THE HONOUR OF FINDING NEW ON AN ISLAND
5105-28240-0012 NEVER MIND NOW INTERPOSED THE CAPTAIN WE WILL TALK OF THAT BY AND BY
5105-28240-0013 NOTHING MORE THAN YOU KNOW YOURSELF
5105-28240-0014 ARE YOU CERTAIN THAT THIS IS THE MEITERRANEAN
5105-28240-0015 FOR SOME MOMENTS HE SEEMED PERFECTLY STUPIAFIED AND THEN RECOVERING HIMSELF HE BEGAN TO OVERWHELM THECUNT WITH A TORRENT OF QUESTIONS
5105-28240-0016 TO ALL THESE INQUIRIES THE COUNT RESPONDED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE
5105-28240-0017 SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE SEEMED TO HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT A CONVULTION OF THE ELEMENTS
5105-28240-0018 YOU WILL TAKE ME ON BOARD COUNT WILL YOU NOT
5105-28240-0019 MYCH IS AT YOUR SERVICE SIR EVEN SHOULD YOU REQUIRE TO MAKE AETURROUND THE WORLD
5105-28240-0020 THE COUNT SHOOK HIS HEAD
5105-28240-0021 BEFORE STARTING IT WAS INDISPENSABLE THAT THE ENGINE OF THE DOBINA SHOULD BE REPAIRED TO SAIL UNDER CANVAS ONLY WOULD IN CONTRARY WINDS AND ROUGH SEASE BE BOTH TEDIOUS AND DIFFICULT
5105-28240-0022 IT WAS ON THE LAST DAY OF JANUARY THAT THE REPAIRS OF THE SCHOONER WERE COMPLETED
5105-28240-0023 A SLIGHT DIMINUITION IN THE EXCESSIVELY HIGH TEMPERATURE WHICH HAD PREVAILED FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS WAS THE ONLY APPARENT CHANGE IN THE GENERAL ORDER OF THINGS BUT WHETHER THIS WAS TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO ANY ALTERATION IN THE EARTH'S ORBIT WAS A QUESTION WHICH WOULD STILL REQUIRE SEVERAL DAYS TO DECIDE
5105-28240-0024 DOUBTS NOW AROSE AND SOME DISCUSSION FOLLOWED WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS DESIRABLE FOR BENSO IF TO ACCOMPANY HIS MASTER
5105-28241-0000 HER SEA GOING QUALITIES WERE EXCELLENT AND WOULD HAVE AMPLY SUFFICED FOR A CIRCUMVIGATION OF THE COLOBE
5105-28241-0001 AFTER AN APRENTISHHIP ON A MERCHANTSHIP HE HAD ENTERED THE IMPERIAL NAVY AND HAD ALREADY REACHED THE RANK OF LIEUTENANT WHEN THECCOUNT APPOINTED HIM TO THE CHARGE OF HIS OWN PRIVATE YACH IN WHICH HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO SPEND BY FARTHER GREATER PART OF HIS TIME THROUGHOUT THE WINTER GENERALLY CRUISING IN THE MEDITERRANEIAN WHILSTOM THE SUMMER HE VISITED MORE NORTHERN WATERS
5105-28241-0002 THE LATE ESTOUNDING EVENTS HOWEVER HAD RENDERED PROKPE MANIFASTLY UNEASY AND NOT TO LESS SO FROM HIS CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THE COUNT SECRETLY PARTOOK OF HIS OWN ANXIETY
5105-28241-0003 STEAM UP AND CANVAS SPREAD THE SCHOONER STARTED EASTWARDS
5105-28241-0004 ALTHOUGH ONLY A MODERATE BREEZE WAS BLOWING THE SEA WAS ROUGH A CIRCUMSTANCE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR ONLY BY THE DIMUNITIONATE IN THE FORCE OF THE EARTH'S OFTRACTION RENDERING THE LIQUID PARICLE SO BUYANT THAT BY THE MERE EFFECT OF OSLLATION THEY WERE CARRIED TO A HEIGHT THERE WAS QUITE UNPRECEDENTED
5105-28241-0005 FOR A FEW MILES SHE FOLLOWED THE LINE HITHERTO PRESUMABLY OCCUPIED BY THE COAST OF ALJRIA BUT NO LAND APPEARED TO THE SOUTH
5105-28241-0006 THE LOG AND THECPASS THEREFORE WERE ABLE TO BE CALLED UPON TO DO THE WORK OF THE SXTANT WHICH HAD BECOME UTTERLY USELESS
5105-28241-0007 THERE'S NO FEAR OF THAT SIR
5105-28241-0008 OF THE EARTH HAS UNDOUBTEDLY ENTERED UPON A NEW ORBIT BUT SHE IS NOT INCURRING ANY PROBABLE RISK OF BEING PRECIPITATED ON TO THE SON
5105-28241-0009 AND WHAT DEMONSTRATION DO YOU OFFER ASKED SERVEDA BACK EAGERLY THAT IT WILL NOT HAPPEN
5105-28241-0010 OCEAN RAINED SUPREME
5105-28241-0011 ALL THE IMAGES OF HIS PAST LIFE FLOATED UPON HIS MEMORY HIS THOUGHTS SPED AWAY TO HIS NATIVE FRANCE ONLY TO RETURN AGAIN TO WONDERHTHER THE DEPTH SAVOCE WOULD REVEAL ANY TRACES OF THE AUJRIAN METROPOLIS
5105-28241-0012 IS IT NOT IMPOSSIBLE HE MURMURED ALOUD THAT ANY CITY SHOULD DISAPPEARED SO COMPLETELY
5105-28241-0013 WOULD NOT THE LOFTIEST EMINENCES OF THE CITY AT LEAST BE VISIBLE
5105-28241-0014 ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE WAS MOST REMARKABLE
5105-28241-0015 TO THE SURPRISE OF ALL AND ESPECIALLY OF LIEUTENANT PROCOBE THE LINE INDICATED A BOTTOM AT A NEARLY UNIFORMED DEPTH OF FROM FORTIFY FATHOMS AND ALTHOUGH THE SOUNDING WAS PERSEVERED WITH CONTINUOUSLY FOR MORE THAN TWO HOURS OVER A CONSIDERABLE A AREA THE DIFFERENCES OF LEVEL WERE INSIGNIFICANT NOT CORRESPONDING IN ANY DEGREE TO WHAT WOULD BE EXPECTED OVER THE SIGHT OF A CITY THAT HAD BEEN TERRIST LIKE THE SEATS OF AN AMPHITH THEATRE
5105-28241-0016 YOU MUST SEE LIEUTENANT I SHOULD THINK THAT WE ARE NOT SO NEAR THE COAST OF ALJRIA AS YOU IMAGINED
5105-28241-0017 AFTER PONDERING A WHILE HE SAID IF WE WERE FARTHER AWAY I SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND A DEPTH OF TWO OR THREE HUNDRED FATHOMS INSTEAD OF FIVE FATHOMS FIVE FATHOMS
5105-28241-0018 ITS DEPTH REMAINED INVARIABLE STILL FOUR OR AT MOST FIVE FATHOMS AND ALTHOUGH ITS BOTTOM WAS ASIDUOUSLY DREDGED IT WAS ONLY TO PROVE IT BARON OF MARINE PRODUCTION OF ANY TYPE
5105-28241-0019 NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE BUT TO PUT ABOUT AND RETURN AND DISAPPOINTMENT TOWARD THE NORTH

5639-40744-0023 WHEN THE BOY WALK TO THE STREETS BLESSINGS WERE SHOWERED UPON HIM BY ALL WHO SAW HIM BLESSING UPON HIS BEAUTY UPON THE MOTHER THAT BORE HIM UPON THE FATHER THAT BEGT HIM UPON THOSE WHO BROUGHT HIM NOT SO WELL
5639-40744-0024 ONE DAY WHEN THE BOY WAS SENT BY HIS GRANDFATHER WITH A MESSAGE TO A RELATION HE PASS ALONG A STREET IN WISH THERE WAS A GREAT CONQOURSE OF HORSEMEN
5639-40744-0025 THE BED SHE TOO WELL REMEMBERED WAS THERE AND ABOVE ALL THE CABINET ON WHICH HAD STOOD THE IMAGE SHE HAD TAKEN AWAY WAS STILL IN THE SAME SPOT
5639-40744-0026 LOIS WAS OUT OF DANGER IN A FORTNIGHT IN A MONTH HE AROSE FROM HIS BED AND DWING ALL THAT TIME HE WAS VISITED DAILY BY HIS MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER AND TREATED BY THE MASTER AND MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE AS IF HE WAS THEIR OWN CHILD
5639-40744-0027 THUS SAYING AND PRESSING THE CRRUCIFIXED TO HER BREAST SHE FELL FAINTING INTO THE ARMS OF DONA ISAPANIA WHOS A GENTLEERWOMAN TO WHOSE SEX PITY AS A NATURAL AS CRUELTY AS TO MAN INSTANTLY PRESSED HER LIPS TO THOSE IN THE FAINTING GIRL SHUDTING OVER HER SO MANY TEARS THAT THEIR NEEDED NO OTHER SPRINKLING OF WATER TO RECOVER LOCADIOA FROM HER SWOON
5639-40744-0028 I HAVE QUAK THINGS TO TELL YOU SENNOR SAID DONSAFYIA TO HER HUSBAND THE CREAMAN SUBSTANCE OF WHICH IS THIS THE FAINTING GIRL BEFORE YOU IS YOUR DAUGHTER AND THE BOY AS YOUR GRANDSON
5639-40744-0029 THIS TRUTH WHICH I HAVE LEARNED FROM HER LIPS IS CONFOMED BY HIS FACE IN WHICH WE HAVE BOTH BE HELD THAT OF OUR SON
5639-40744-0030 JUST THAT LELUCATO CAME TO HERSELF AN EMBRACING THECROSS SEEMED CHANGED INTO A SEA OF TEARERS AND THE GENTLEMAN REMAINING IN OUTTERLYWILDEROMAN UNTIL HIS WIFE HAD REPEATED TO HIM FROM BEGINNING TO IN NELURCYOAS WHOLE STORY AND HE BELIEVED IT THROUGH THE BLESS OF DISPENSATION OF HEAVEN WHICH HAD CONFIRMED IT BY SO MANY CONVINCING TESTIMENS
5639-40744-0031 SO PERSUASIVE WERE HER ENTREATIES AND SO STRONG HER ASSURANCE AS THAT NO HARM WHATEVER COULD RESULT TO THEM FROM THE INFORMATION SHE SOUGHT THEY WERE INDUCED TO CONFESS THAT ONE SUMMER'S NIGHT THE SAME SHE HAD MENTION THEMSELVES IN ANOTHER FRIEND BEING OUT ON THE STROLL WITH HER DE DOLEFUL THEY HAD BEEN CONCERNED IN THE ADDUCTION OF THE GIRL WHOM WERE DOLEFUL CARRIED OFF WIL WAS THE REST OF THEM DETAINED HER FAMILY WHO MADE A GREAT OUTCRYY AND WOULD HAVE DEFENDED HER IF THEY COULD
5639-40744-0032 FOR GOD'S SAKE MY LADY MOTHER GIVE ME A WIFE WHO WOULD BE AN AGREEABLE COMPANION NOT ONE WHO WORL DISGUST ME SON AT ME MYY BOTH BEAR EVENLY AND WITH MUTUAL GOOD WILL THE YOKE IMPSEDON US BY HEAVEN HASAD OF PULLING THIS WAY IN THAT WAY AND FRETTING EACH OTHER TO DEATH
5639-40744-0033 HER BEARING WAS GRACEFUL AND ANIMATED SHE LED HER SON BY THE HAND AND BEFORE HER WALKED TWO MAIDS WITH WAX LIGHTS AND SILVER CANALSTICKS
5639-40744-0034 ALL ROSE TO DO HER REVERENCE AS OF SOMETHING FROM HEAVEN HAD MIRACULOUSLY APPEARED BEFORE THEM BUT GAZING ON HER AND TRANSED WITH ADMIRATION NOT ONE OF THEM WAS ABLE TO ADDRESS A SINGLE WORD TO HER
5639-40744-0035 SHE REFLECTED HOW NEAR SHE IS STOOD TO THE CRISIS WHICH WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER SHE WAS TO BE BLESSED OR UNHAPPY FOR EVER AND RACKED BY THE INTENSITY OF HER EMOTIONS SHE SUDDENLY CHANGED COLOR HER HAD DROPPED AND SHE FELL FORWARD IN A SWOON INTO THE ARMS OF THE DISMAYEST AFONIA
5639-40744-0036 HIS MOTHER HAD LEFT HER TO HIM AS BEING HER DISINED PROTECTOR BUT WHEN HE SAW THAT HE TOO WAS INSENSIBLE SHE WAS NEAR MAKING A THIRD AND WOULD HAVE DONE SO HAD HE NOT COME TO HIMSELF
5639-40744-0037 NO THEN SON ON MY HEART THAT THIS FAINTING LADY IS YOUR REAL BRIDE I SAY REAL BECAUSE SHE IS THE ONE WHOM YOU FATHER AND I HAVE CHOSEN FOR YOU AND A PORTRAIT WAS APPTENCE
5639-40744-0038 JUST AT A MOMENT WHEN THE TEARS OF THE PITYING BEHOLDDERS FLOWED FASTEST AND THEIR E JACULATIONS WHERE MOST EXPRESSIVE OF DESPAIR VI OCADIA GO'S SIGNS OF RECOVERY AND BROUGHT BACKLADNESS FOR THE HEARTS OF ALL

5639-40744-0040 THIS WAS DONE FOR THE EVENT TOOK PLACE AT A TIME WITH A CONSENT OF THE PARTIES WAS SUFFICIENT FOR THE CELEBRATION OF A MARRIAGE WITHOUT ANY OF THE PRELIMINARY FORMALITIES WHICH ARE NOW SO PROPERLY REQUIRED
5639-40744-0041 NORIS WERE DO OFFUL LESS SURPRISED THAN THEY AND THE BETTER TO ASSURE HIMSELF HER SO WONDERFUL EF FAECT HE BEGG LOCATIA TO GIVE HIM SOME TOKEN WHICH SHOULD MAKE PERFECTLY CARLEE TO HIM THAT WHICH INDEED HE DID NOT DOUBT SINCE IT WAS AUTHENTICATED HIS PENS

5683-32865-0010 I WAS THINKING IT'S A VERY  LIKED THE ACE OF HEARTS ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN SOFTLY SMILING ON
5683-32865-0011 WHEREUPON LAKE LAUGHED QUIETLY STILL LOOKING ON THE ACE OF HEARTS WITH HIS SLY EYES

6930-76324-0020 YET LITTLE AS IT WAS IT HAD ALREADY MADE A VAST DIFFERENCE IN THE ASPECT OF THE ROOM
6930-76324-0021 SURFACE DOUS AT LEASTE HAD BEEN REMOVED AND THE FINE OLD FNITURE GAVE A HINT OF ITS REAL ELEGANCE AND POOLISH
6930-76324-0022 THENA SHE SUDDENLY REMARKED

6930-76324-0027 FORGETTING ALL THEIR WEARINESS THEY SEES THEIR CANDLES AND STURY THROUGH THE HOUSE FINDING ON OCCASIONAL PAPER TECKPED AWAY IN SOME OUD CORNER
6930-76324-0028 WELL AND CONVINCED AT THE BOARDED UP HOUSE MYSTERY HAPPENED NOT EARLIER THAN APON SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE AND PROBABLY NOT MUCH LATER
6930-81414-0000 NO WORDS WERE SPOKEN NO LANGUAGE WAS UTTERED SAVE THAT OF WAILING IN HISSING AND THAT SOMEHOW WAS INDISTINCT AS IF IT EXISTED IN FANCY AND NO NOT IN REALITY
6930-81414-0001 I HEARD AN NOISE BEHIND I TURNED AND SOL CFFOR HIS BLACK EYES SHINING WHIL IN HIS HAND HE HELD A GLEAMING KNIFE HE LIFTED IT ABOVE HIS HEAD AS IF TO STRIKE BUT A HA HAD THE STRENGTH OF TEN MEN AND I HURLED HIM FROM ME
6930-81414-0002 ONOR SAID A DISTANT VOICE
6930-81414-0003 NO SOUND BROKE THE STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT
6930-81414-0004 THE STORY OF ITS EVIL INFLUENCE CAME BACK TO ME AND IN MY BEWILDERED CONDITION I WONDERED WHETHER THERE WAS NOT SOME TRUTH AND WHAT HAD BEEN SAID
6930-81414-0005 WHAT WAS THAT
6930-81414-0006 WHAT THEN A HUMAN HAND LARGE AND SHAPELY APPEARED DISTINCTLY ON THE SURFACE OF THE POND
6930-81414-0007 NOTHING MORE NOT EVEN THE RIST TO WHICH IT MIGHT BE ATTACHED
6930-81414-0008 IT DID NOT BECKON OR INDEED MOVE AT ALL IT WAS AS STILL AS THE HAND OF DEATH
6930-81414-0009 I AWOKE TO CONSCIOUSNESS FIGHTING AT FIRST AS SEEMED AS IF I WAS FIGHTING WITH THE PHANTOM A GRADUALLY MY OPPONENT BECAME MORE REAL TO ME IT WAS CATHER
6930-81414-0010 A SOUND OF VOICES A FLASH OF LIGHT
6930-81414-0011 A FEELING OF FREEDOM AND I WAS AWAKE WHERE
6930-81414-0012 SAID ANOTHER VOICE WHICH I RECOGNIZED THAT FULL TES CATHERFOR
6930-81414-0013 I HAD SCARCELY KNOWN WHEN I HAD BEEN SAYING OR DOING UP TO THIS TIME BUT AS HE SPOKE I LOOKED AT MY HAND
6930-81414-0014 IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON I SAW IN KNIFE RED WITH BLOOD AND MY HAND TOO WAS ALSO DISCLORED
6930-81414-0015 I DO NOT KNOW I AM DAGED BEWILDERED
6930-81414-0016 WITH THAT IS CATHERF'S KNIFE
6930-81414-0017 I KNOW HE HAD IT THIS VERY EVENING
6930-81414-0018 OUR RUEMBERED SAYING HAVE WE' BEEN TOGETHER
6930-81414-0019 OH CHAER PICKED UP SOMETHING FROM THE GROUND AND LOOKED AT IT
6930-81414-0020 I SAY YOU DO KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS AND YOU MUST TELL US
6930-81414-0021 A TERRIBLE THOUGHT FLASHED INTO MY MIND
6930-81414-0022 I HAD AGAIN BEEN ACTING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THIS MAN'S POWER
6930-81414-0023 PORCHANCE TOO CAFFOR'S DEATH MIGHT SERVE HIM IN GOOD STEAD
6930-81414-0024 MY TONGUE REFUSED ARTICULATE MY POWER OF SPEECH LAFHTED ME
6930-81414-0025 MY POSITION WAS TOO TERRIBLE
6930-81414-0026 MY OVERROUGHTTEN NERVES SIELDED ATLAST
6930-81414-0027 FOR SOME TIME AFTER THAT I REMEMBERED NOTHING DISTINCTLY
7021-79730-0000 THE THREE MODS OF MANAGEMENT
7021-79730-0001 TO SUPPOSE THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS WORK IS TO AID IN AFFECTING SUCH A SUBSTITUTION AS THAT IS ENTIRELY TO MISTAKE ITS NATURE AND DESIGN
7021-79730-0002 BY REASON AN AFFECTION
7021-79730-0003 AS THE CHASE DRIVES AWAY MERY STANDS BEWILDERED AND PERPLEXED ON THE DOOR STEP HER MIND IN A TUMULT OF EXCITEMENT IN WHICH HATRED OF THE DOCTOR DISTRUST AND SUSPICION OF HER MOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT VEXATION AND ILL HUMOUR SERGE AND SWELL AMONG THOSE DELICATE ORGANIZATIONS ON WHICH THE STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUL SO CLOSELY DEPEND DOING PERHAPS AND A REPARABLE IJURY
7021-79730-0004 THE MOTHER AS SOON AS THE CHASE IS SO FARTURNED THAT MERRY CAN NO LONGER WATCH THE EXPRESSION OF HER CONFIDENCE GOES AWAY FROM THE DOOR WITH A SMILE OF COMPLACENCY AND SAINISFACTION ON HER FACE AT THE INGENUITY AN EXCESS OF HER LITTLE ARTIFIC
7021-79730-0005 SO YOU WILL BE A GOOD GIRL I KNOW AND NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE BUT WILL STAY AT HOME CONTENTEDLY WON'T YOU
7021-79730-0006 THE MOTHER IN MANAGING THE CASE IN THIS WAY REALIZED PARTLY ON CONONVINCING THE REASON OF THE CHILD AND PARTLY ON AN APPEAL TO HER AFFECTION
7021-79730-0007 IF YOU SHOULD NOT BE A GOOD GIRL BUT SHOULD SHOW SIGN OF MAKING US ANY TROUBLE I SHALL HAVE TO SCEND YOU OUT SOMEWHERE TO THE BACK PART OF THE HOUSE UNTIL WE ARE GONE
7021-79730-0008 BUT THIS LAST SUPPOSITION IS ALMOST ALWAYS UNNECESSARY FOR IF MARRY HAS BEEN HABITUALLY MANAGED ON THIS PRINCIPLE SHE WILL NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE
7021-79730-0009 IT IS INDEED TRUE THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF TACT AND SKILL IN THE TRAINING OF THE YOUNG AND OF CULTIVATING THEIR REASON AND SECURING THEIR AFFECTION CANN NOT BE ORATED
7021-79740-0000 TO SUCH PERSONS THESE INDURATE MOODES OF TRAINING CHILDREN INHABITS OF SUBORDINATION TO THEIR WILL OR RATHER OF YIELDING TO THEIR INFLUENCE ARE SPECIALLY USEFUL
7021-79740-0001 DELA HAD A YOUNG SISTER NAMEDRIA AND A COUSIN WHOSE NAME WAS JANE
7021-79740-0002 NOW DELA CONTRIVED TO OBTAIN A GREAT INFLUENCE AND AS SENDENCY OVER THE MIND OF THE CHILDREN BY MEANS OF THESE DOLLS
7021-79740-0003 TO GIVE AN IDEA OF THESE CONVERSATIONS I WILL REPORT ONE OF THEM IN FULL
7021-79740-0004 YOU HAVE COME AND DELAOR AND DELAAH WAS THE NAME OF JANE STALL TO MAKE ROSALLY A VISIT
7021-79740-0005 I AM VERY GLAD
7021-79740-0006 I EXPECT YOU HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD GIRL AND DELAA SINCE YOU WERE HER LAST
7021-79740-0007 THEN TURNING TO JANE SHE ASKED IN A SOMEWHER ALARED TONE HAS SHEEAP IN A GOOD GIRL JANE
7021-79740-0008 FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN PLAYING UPON THE PIAZZA WITH BLOCKS AND OTHER PLAY THINGS AND FINALLY HAD GONE INTO THE HOUSE LEAVING ALL THE THINGS ON THE FLOOR OF VI PIAZZA INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM AWAY IN THEIR PLACES AS THEY OUGHT TO HAVE DONE
7021-79740-0009 THEY WERE NOW PLAING WITH THEIR DOLLS IN THE PARLOR
7021-79740-0010 DELLY CAME TO THE PARLOR AND WITH AN AIR OF GREAT MYSTERY BECKONED THE CHILDREN ASIDE AND SAID TO THEM IN A WHISPER LEAVE AND DELA AND ROSALLY HERE AND DON'T SAY A WORD TO THEM
7021-79740-0011 SO SAYING SHE LED THE WAYWA ON TIPO FOLLOWED BY THE CHILDREN OUT OF THE ROOM AND ROUND BY A SIR KUITUS ROOT TO THE PIAZZA THERE
7021-79740-0012 SAID SHE POINTING THE BLAY THINGS SEE
7021-79740-0013 PUST THESE PLE THINGS ALL AWAY QUICK AND CAREFULLY AND WE WILL NOT LET THEM NO ANY THING ABOUT YOUR LELIEVING THEM MO OUTTAIN
7021-79740-0014 AND DISMTHOD OF TREATING THE CASE WAS MUCH MORE EFFECTUAL IN MAKING THEM DISPOSED TO AVOID COMMITTING A SIMILAR FAULT ANOTHER TIME THAN ANY DIRECT REVUKES OR EXPRESSIONS OF DISPLEASURE ADDRESSED PERSALLY TO THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN
7021-79759-0000 NATURE OF THE EFFECT PRODUCED BY EARLY IMPRESSIONS
7021-79759-0001 THAT IS COMPARATIVELY NOTHING
7021-79759-0002 THEIR ARE CHIEFLY FORMED FROM COMBINATIONS OF THE IMPRESSIONS MADE IN CHILDHOOD
7021-79759-0003 VAST IMPORTANCE AND INFLUENCE OF THIS MENTAL FURNISHING
7021-79759-0004 WEOUT GOING TO ANY SUCH EXTREMEO AS THIS WE CAN EASILY SEE ON REFLECTION HOW VAST IN INFLUENCE ON THE IDEAS AND CONCEPTIONS AS WELL AS ON THE PRINCIPLES OF ACTION IN MATURE YEARS MUST BE EXERTED BY THE NATURE AND CHARACTER OF THE IMAGES WHICH THE PERIOD OF INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD IMPRESS UPON THE MIND
7021-79759-0005 THE PAIN PRODUCED BY AN ACT OF HASTY AND ANGRY VIOLENCE TO WHICH A FATHER' SUBJECTS HIS SON MAY SOON PASS AWAY BUT THE MEMORY OF IT DOES NOT PASS AWAY WITH THE PAIN
7021-85628-0000 BUT ANDS CARED NOTHING ABOUT THAT
7021-85628-0001 HE MADE A B ABOUT SO DEEP THAT HIS BACK CAME NEAR BREAKING AND HE WAS DONE FOUNDED I CAN TELL YOU WHEN HE SAW IT WAS NOBODY BUT ANDS
7021-85628-0002 HE WAS SUCH A BIG BOY THAT HE WORE HIGH BOOATS AND CARRIED A JACKK KNIFE
7021-85628-0003 NOW THIS KNIFE WAS ASSLENDID ONE THOUGH HALF THE BLADE WAS GONE AND HANDLE WAS A LITTLE CRACK'ED AND ANDS NEW THAT ONE IS ALMOST A MAN AS SOON AS ONE HAS A JACK KNIFE
7021-85628-0004 YES WHY NOT THOUGHT ANDS
7021-85628-0005 SEEING THAT I AM SO FIVEE I MAY AS WELL GO AND VIESIT THE KING
7021-85628-0006 I AM GOING TO THE COURT BALL ANSWEREDNERS
7021-85628-0007 AND SHE TOOK AND'S HAND AND WALKED WITH HIM UP THE BOAD MARBLE STAIRS WHERE SOLDIERS WEREPSTED AT EVERY THIRD STEP AND THROUGHRE THE MAGNIFICENT HALLS WHERE COURTIERS IN SILK AND VELVET STOOD BOWING WHERE EVER HE WENT
7021-85628-0008 FOUR LIKE AS NOT THEY MUST HAVE THOUGHT HIM A PRINCE WHEN THEY SAW HIS FINE CAP
7021-85628-0009 AT THE FARTHER END OF THE LARGEEST HALL A TABLE WAS SET WITH GOLDEN CUPS AND GOLDEN PLATES IN LONG ROSE
7021-85628-0010 ON HUGE SILVER PLATTERS WERE PYRAREID OF TARTS AND CAKES AND RED WINES SPARKLED IN GLITTERING DECANTERS
7021-85628-0011 THE PRINCESSET DOWN UNDER A BLUE CAOPY WITH BOOKQUS OF ROSES AND SHE LET AND HER SIT IN A GOLDEN CHAIR BY HER SIDE
7021-85628-0012 BUT YOU MUST NOT EAT WITH YOUR CAMP ON YOUR HEAD SHE SAID AND WAS GOING TO THEY GET OFF
7021-85628-0013 THE PRINCESS CERTAINLY WAS BEAUTIFUL AND HE WOULD HAVE DEARLY LIKED TO BE KISSED BY HER BUT THE CAP WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD MADE HE WOULD NOT GIVE UP ON ANY CONDITION
7021-85628-0014 HE ONLY SHOOK HIS HEAD
7021-85628-0015 WELL BUT NOW SAID THE PRINCESS AND SHE FILL HIS POCKETS WITH CAKES AND PUT HER OWN HEAVY GOLD CHAIN AROUND HIS NECK AND BENT DOWN AND KISSED HIM
7021-85628-0016 THAT IS A VERY FINE CAPE HAVE HE SAID
7021-85628-0017 SO WHAT IS SIN ANDS
7021-85628-0018 AND IT IS MADE OF MOTHER'S BEST YORN AND SHE KNITTEDED HERSELF AND EVERYBODY ONCE TO GET IT AWAY FROM ME
7021-85628-0019 WITH ONE JUMP ANDRES GOT OUT OF HIS CHAIR
7021-85628-0020 HE DARTED LA LIKE AN ARROW THROUGH ALL THE HOLES DOWN ALL THE STAIRS AND ACROSS THE YARD
7021-85628-0021 HE STILL HELD ONTO IT WITH BOTH HANDS AS HE RUSHED INTO HIS MOTHER'S COTTAGE
7021-85628-0022 AND ALL HIS BROTHERS AND SIST STOOD ROUND AND LISTENED WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN
7021-85628-0023 BUT WHEN HIS BIG BROTHER HED THAT HE HAD REFUSED TO GIVE HIS CAP FOR A KING'S GOLDEN CROWN HE SAID THAT ANDS WAS A STUPID
7021-85628-0024 ANDS FACE GREW RED
7021-85628-0025 BUT HIS MOTHERGED BEEN CLOSE
7021-85628-0026 NO MY LITTLE SON SHE SAID
7021-85628-0027 IF YOU DRESSED IN SILK AND GOLD FROM TOP TO TOE YOU COULD NOT LOOK ANY NICER THAN IN YOUR LITTLE RED CAP
7127-75946-0000 AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE BANQUET WHICH WAS SERVED AT FIVE O'CLOCK THE KING ENTERED HIS CABINET WERE HIS TAYLORS WHO WERE AWAITING HIM FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRYING ON THE CELEBRATED COSTUME REPRESENTING SPRING WHICH WAS THE RESULT OF SO MUCH IMAGINATION AND HAD CAUSED SO MANY EFFORTS OF THOUGHT TO THE DESIGNERS AND ORNAENT WORKERS OF THE COURT
7127-75946-0001 A A VERY WELL
7127-75946-0002 LET HIM COME IN THEN SAID THE KINGAM AND AS IF COBAR HAD BEEN LISTENING AT THE DOOR FOR THE PURPOSE OF KEEPING HIMSELF AU COOARURANTE WITH THE CONVERSATION HE ENTERED AS SOON AS THE KING HAD PRONOUNCED HIS NAME TO THE TWO CARTIERS
7127-75946-0003 GENTLEAN DEAR POSTS WHEREUPON SAINT ANYAN AND VIEWERY TOOK THEIR LEAVE
7127-75946-0004 CERTAINLY SIR BUT I MUST HAVE MONEY TO DO THAT WHAT
7127-75946-0005 WHAT DO YOU MEAN INQUIRED LOUISE
7127-75946-0006 HE HAS GIVEN THEM WITH TOO MUCH GRACE NOT TO HAVE OTHER STILL TO GIVE IF THEY ARE REQUIRED WHICH IS THE CASE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT
7127-75946-0007 IT IS NECESSARY THEREFORE THAT HE SHOULD COMPLY THE KING FROWNED
7127-75946-0008 DOES YOUR MAJESTY THEN NO LONGER BELIEVE THE DISLOYIL ATTMPT
7127-75946-0009 NOT AT ALL YOU ARE ON THE CONTRARY MOST AGREEABLE TO ME

7127-75946-0011 YOU WILL TAKE THEM FROM MY PRIVATE TREASURE
7127-75946-0012 THE NEWS CIRCULATED WITH THE RAPIDITY OF A LIGHTNING DURING ITS PROGRESS IT CANDLED EVERY VARIOET OF COCATRY DESIRE AND WILD AMBITION
7127-75946-0013 THE KING HAD COMPLETED HIS TOILET BY NINE O'CLOCK HE APPEARED IN AN OPEN CARRIAGE DECORATED WITH BRANCHES OF TREES AND FLOWERS
7127-75946-0014 THE QUEENS HAD TAKEN THEIR SEATS UPON A MAGNIFICENT DAY IS OR PLATFORM ERECTED UPON THE BORDERS OF THE LAKE IN A THEATRE OF WONDERFUL ELEGS OF CONSTRUCTION
7127-75946-0015 SUDDENLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESTORING PEACE IN ORDER SPURING ACCOMPANIED BY HIS WHOLE COURT MADE HIS APPEARANCE
7127-75946-0016 THE SEASONS ALLIES OF SPRING FOLLOWED HIM CLOSELY TO FORM A QUAD DREAL WHICH AFTER MANY WORDS OF MORERA OR LESS FLATTERING IMPORT WAS THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE ANTS
7127-75946-0017 HIS LEGS THE BEST SHAPED AT COURT WERE DISPLAYED TO GREAT ADVANTAGE AND FLESH COLURED SILK AND HOSE OF SILK SO FINE AND SO TRANS PARENT THAT IT SEEMED ALMOST LIKE FLUSH ITSELF
7127-75946-0018 THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS CARRIAGE WHICH RESEMBLED THE BUYIANT MOVEMENTS OF AN IMMORTAL AND HE DID NOT DANCED SO MUCH AS SEEMED TO SOREE ALONG
7127-75946-0019 YES IT IS SUPPRESSED
7127-75946-0020 FAR FROM ITS SIRE YOUR MAJESTY HEVN' GIVEN NO DIRECTIONS ABOUT IT THE MUSITIONS HAVE RETAINDED
7127-75946-0021 YES SIRE AND READDY DRESSED FOR THE BALET
7127-75946-0022 SIRE HE SAID YOUR MAJESTY'S MOST DEVOTED SERVANT APPROACHES TO PERFORM A SERVICE ON THIS OCCASION WITH SIMILAR ZEAL THAT HE HAS ALREADY SHOWNE ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE
7127-75946-0023 THE KING SEEMED ONLY PLEASED WITH EVERY ONE PRESENT
7127-75946-0024 MONSIEERUR WAS THE ONLY WAN WHO DID NOT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT THE MATTER
7127-75946-0025 THE BALLT BEGAN THE EFFECT WAS MORE THAN BEAUTIFUL
7127-75946-0026 WHEN THE MUSIC BY ITS BURSTS OF MELODY CARRIED AWAY THESE ILLUSTRIOUS ST DANCERS WHEN THE SIMPLE UNTUTORED PANTEOMIME OF THAT PERIOD ONLY THE MORE NATURAL ON ACCOUNT OF THE VERY INDIFFERENT ACTING OF THE AUGUST ACTORS HAD REACHED ITS COMULMONATING POINT OF TRIUMPH THE THEATRE SHOOK WITH TUMULTUOUS APPLAUSE
7127-75946-0027 DISDAINFUL OF A SUCCESS OF WHICH MADAME SHOWED NO ACKNOWLEDGMENT HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT BOLDLY REGAINING THE MARKED PREFERENCE OF THE PRINCESS
7127-75946-0028 BY DEGREES ALL HIS HAPPINESS ALL HIS BRILLIANCY SUBSIDED INTO REGRET AND UNEASINESS SO THAT HIS LIMBS LOST THEIR POWER HIS ARMS HUNG HEAVILY BY HIS SIDES AND HIS HEAD DROUPED AS THOUGH HE WAS STUPEFIED
7127-75946-0029 THE KING WHO HAD FROM THIS MOMENT BECOME IN REALITY THE PRINCIPLE DANCER IN THE QWUADRIAL CAST A LOOK UPON HIS VANQUIST RIVAL
7127-75947-0000 EVERYONE COULD OBSERVE HIS AGITATION AND PROSTRATION APSTRATION WHICH WAS INDEED THE MORE REMARKABLE SINCE PEOPLE WERE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO SEE HIM WITH HIS ARMS HANGING LISTLESSLY BY HIS SIDE HIS HEAD BEWILDERED AND HIS EYES WITH ALL THEIR BRIGHT INTELLIGENCE BE DEMNED
7127-75947-0001 UPON THIS MADAME DINED TO TURN HER EYES LANGUISHINGLY TOWARDS OF THE CONT OBSERVING

7127-75947-0008 THE AROW PIERCED HIS HEART AND WOUNDED HIM MORTALLY
7127-75947-0009 A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AFTERWARDS HE RETURNED TO THE THEATRE BUT IT WILL BE READILY BELIEVED THAT IT WAS ONLY A POWERFUL EFFORT OF REASON OVER HIS GREAT EXCITEMENT THAT ENABLED HIM TO GO BACK OR PERHAPS FOR LOVE IS THUS STRANGELY CONSTITUTED HE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE EVEN TO REMAIN MUCH LONGER SEPARATED FROM THE PRESENCE OF ONE WHO HAD BROKEN HIS HEART
7127-75947-0010 WHEN SHE PERCEIVED THE YOUNG MAN SHE ROSE LIKE A WOMAN SURPRISED IN A MIDST OF IDEAAS SHE WAS DESIROUS OF CONCEALING FROM HERSELF

7127-75947-0039 IN FACT THE SOUND OF MADAMES AND THE QUEEN'S CARRIAGES COULD BE HEARD IN THE DISTANCE UPON THE HARD DRY GROUND OF THE ROADS FOLLOWED BY THE MOUNTAIN CAVALIERS
7127-75947-0040 IN THIS WAY THE FET OF THE WHOLE COURT WAS A FET ALSO FOR THE MYSTERIOUS INHABITANTS OF THE FOREST FOR CERTAINLY THE DEAR IN THE BREAK THE PEASANT ON THE BRANCH THE FOX IN ITS WHOLE WERE ALL LISTENING
7176-88083-0000 ALL ABOUT HIM WAS A TUMULT OF BRIGHT AND BROKEN COLOOR SCATTERED AND BROAD SPLASHES

7176-88083-0013 LIKE HIS UNFORTUNATE LITTLE COUSIN THE TEEL HE TOO HAD FELT A FEAR OF DEATH MIITTEN INTO HIS HEART AND WAS HEADING DESPERATELY FOR THE REFUWGE OF SOME DARK OVER HANGING BANK DEEP FRINGED WITH WEEDS WERE THE DREADFUL EYE OF THE HAWK SHOULD NOT DISCERN HIM
7176-88083-0014 THE HAWK SAT UPON THE BRANCH AND WATCH HIS QUARRIRY SWIMMING BENEATH THE SURFACE
7176-88083-0015 ALMOST INSTANTLY WHO HAS FORCED TO THE TOP
7176-88083-0016 STRAIGHTWAY THE WHOLK GLIGHTED FROM HIS PURST AND DARTED AFTER HIM
7176-88083-0017 BUT AT THIS POINT IN THE RAPIDS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO STAY DOWN
7176-88083-0018 BUT THIS FREQUENTURE OF THE HEIGHTS OF AIR FOR ALL HIS SAVAGE VALLOR WAS TROUBLED AT THE LEAPING WAVES IN THE TOSSING FOM OF THESE MAD RAPIDS HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THEM
7176-88083-0019 AS HE FLEW HIS DOWN REACHING CLUTCHING TALNS WERE NOT HALF A YARDABLE THE FUGIT HIS HEAD
7176-88083-0020 WERE THE WAVES FOR AN INSTANT SANK IF THEY CAME CLOSER BUT NOT QUITE WITHIN GRASPING REACH
7176-88083-0021 BUT AS BEFORE THE LEAPING WAVES OF THE RAPIDS WERE TOO MUCH FOR HIS PURSUER AND DOEL ABLE TO FLAP HIS WAY ONWARD IN THE CLOUD OF FHOAMIL DOOM HUNG LOB OF HIS HEAD YET HESITATED TO STRIKE
7176-88083-0022 THE HAWK EMBITTERED BY THE LOSS OF HIS FIRST QUARY HAD BECOME AS DOGGED IN PURSUIT AS A W WEHASEL NOT TO BE SHAKEN OFF OR EVADED OR DECEIVED
7176-88083-0023 HE HAD A LOT OF LINE OUT AND THE PLACE WAS NONE TOO FREE FOR A LONG CAST BUT HE WAS IMPATIENT TO DROP HIS FLIES AGAIN ON THE SPOT WHERE THE BIG FISH WAS FEEDING
7176-88083-0024 THE LAST DRRAOPP FLY AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT CAUGHT JUST IN THE CORNER OF THE HAWKS ANGRILY OPEN BEAK HO LOOKING ITSELF FIRMLY
7176-88083-0025 AT THE SUDDEN SHARP STING OF IT THE GREAT BIRD TURNED HIS HEAD AND NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE FISHERMAN STANDING ON THE BANK
7176-88083-0026 THE DRAG UPON HIS BEAK AND THE LIGHT CHECK UPON HIS WINGS WERE INEXPLICABLE TO HIM AND APPALLING

7729-102255-0001 THIS WAS AT THE MARCH ELECTION EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE
7729-102255-0002 THAT SUMMER'S EMMIGRATION HOWEVER BEING MAINLY FROM THE FREE STS GREATLY CHANGED THE RELATIVE STRENGTHS OF THE TWO PARTIES
7729-102255-0003 FOR GENERAL SERVICE THEREFORE REQUIRING NO SPECIAL EFFORT THE NEMERICAL STRENGTH OF THE FACTIONS WAS ABOUT EQUAL WHILE ON EXTRAORDINARY OCCASIONS THE TWO THOUSAND BORDER RFFE AND RESERVE LYING A LITTLE FARTHER BACK FORM THE STATE LINE COULD AT ANY TIME EASILY TURNED THE SCALE
7729-102255-0004 THE FREE STATE MEN HAD ONLY THEIR CONVICTIONS THEIR INTELLIGENCE THEIR COURAGE AND THE MORAL SUPPORT OF THE NORTH THE CONSPIRACY HAD ITS SECRET COMBINATION THE TERRITORIALFICIALS THE LEGISLATURE THE BOGAS LAWS THE COURTS THE MILITIA OFFICERS THE PRESIDENT AND THE ARMY

7729-102255-0012 SEVERAL HUNDRED FREE STATE MEN PROMPTLY RESPONDED TO THE SUMMONS
7729-102255-0013 IT WAS IN FACT THE BEST WEAPON OF ITS DAY
7729-102255-0014 THE LEADERS OF THE CONSPIRACY BECAME DISTRUSTFUL OF THEIR POWER TO CRUSH THE TOWN

7729-102255-0021 BUT THE AFFAIR WAS MAGNIFIED AS A CROWNING PROOF THAT THE FREE STATE MEN WERE INSURRECTIONS AND OUTLAWS
7729-102255-0022 FROM THESE AGAIN SPRANG BARRICATED AND FORTIFIED DWELLINGS CAMPSON SCOUPT PARTIES FINALLY CULMINATING IN ROVING GRILL A BANDS HALF PARTIS AND HALF PREDATORY
7729-102255-0023 THEIR DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERS HOWEVER DISPLAY ONE BROAD AND UNFAILING DIFFERENCE
7729-102255-0024 THE FREE STATE MEN CLUNG TO THEIR PRAIRIE TOWNS AND PRAIRIEOR VEINES WITH ALL THE OBSTINACY AND COURAGE OF TRUY FENDERS OF THEIR HOMES AND FIRE SIDES
7729-102255-0025 THEY ASSUMED CHARACTER CHANGED WITH THEIR CHANGING OPPORTUNITIES OR NECESSITIES
7729-102255-0026 IN THE SHOOTING OF SHERIF JONES AND LAWRNENCE AND IN THE REFUSAL OF EXCVERNOR READER TO ALLOW THE DEPUTY MARSHAL TO ARAST HIM THEY DISCOVERED GRAVE OFFENCES AGAINST THE TERRITORIAL AND THE UNITED STS LAWS
7729-102255-0027 FOOTMOT SUMNUR TO CHANON MAY TWELVE EIGHTEEN PIFTY SIX
7729-102255-0028 PRIVATE PERSONS WHO AT LEAST THE FREE STIGHT HOTEL VAINLY BESOUGHW THE VARIOUS AUTHORITIES TO PRESENT THE DESTRUCTION OF THEIR PROPERTY
7729-102255-0029 TEN DAYS WERE CONSUMED IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS BUT THE SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE REFUSED TO YIELD
7729-102255-0030 HE SUMMONED HAPPYED DOZEN CITIZENS TOJIN HIS POSSI WHO FOLLOWED OBEYED AND ASSISTED HIM

7729-102255-0033 AS HE HAD PROMISED TO PROTECT THE HOTEL THE REASSURED CITIZENS BEGAN TO LAUGH AT THEIR OWN FIEARS
7729-102255-0034 TO THEIR SORROW THEY WERE SOON UNECEIVED
7729-102255-0035 THE MILITARY FORCE PARTLY RABBLE PARTLY ORGANIZED HAD MEANWHILE MOVED INTO THE TOWN
7729-102255-0036 HE PLANEED AC COMPANY BEFORE THE HOTEL AND DEMANDED A SURRENDER OF THE ARMS BELONGING TO THE FREE STATE MILITARY COMPANIES
7729-102255-0037 HALF AN HOUR LATER TURNING A DEAF EAR TO ALL REMONSTRANCE HE GAVE THE PROPRIETORS UNTIL FIVE O'CLOCK TO REMOVE THEIR FAMIIES AND PERSONAL PROPERTY FROM THE FREE STATE HOTEL
7729-102255-0038 AJTSON WHO HAD BEEN HURNGING THE MOB PLANTED HIS TWO GUNANS BEFORE THE BUILDING AND TRAINED THEM UPON IT
7729-102255-0039 THE INMS BEING REMOVED AT THE APPOINTED HOUR A FEW CANNON BALLS WERE FIRED TO THE STONE WALLS
7729-102255-0040 IN THIS INCIDENT CONTRASTING THE CREATIVE AND THE DESTRUCTIVE SPIRIT OF THE FACTIONS THE EMIGRANT AID SOCIETY OF MASSACHUSES VIINDS IT IS MOST HONORABLE AND TRIUMPHANT BENDICATION
7729-102255-0041 THE WHOLE PROCEEDING WAS SO CHILDISH THE MISERABLE PLANT SO TRANSPARENT THE OUTRAGE SO GROWS AS TO BRING DISGUSSED TO THE BETTER CLASS OF BORDER RUFFIANS WHO WERE WITNESSES AND EXCESSORIES
7729-102255-0042 RELCATED FOOTNU GOVERNOR ROBINSON BEING ON HIS WAY EAST THE STEAMBOAT ON WHICH HE WAS TRAVELLING STOPPED AT LEXING TON MUSURI
7729-102255-0043 IN A FEW DAYS AN OFFICEER CAME WITH A REQUISITION FROM GOVERNOR SHNNIN AND TOOK THE PRISONER BY LAND A WESTPORT AND AFTERWARDS FROM THERE TO CANANS A CITY E LEVENWORTH

7729-102255-0045 CAPTAIN MARTIN SAID I SHALL GIVE YOU A PISTOL TO OUT PROTECT YOURSELF IF WORSE COMES TO WORST
7729-102255-0046 IN THE EARLY MORNING OF THE NEXT DAY MAY TWENTY NINETH A COMPANY OF DRAOONS WITH ONE EMPTY SADDLE CAME DOWN FROM THE FORT AND WHILE THE PROSTLAVERY MEN STILL SLEPT THE PRISONER IN HIS ESCORT WERE ON THEIR WAY ACROSS THE PRAIRIEERS TO THECPTON IN THE CHARGE OF OFFICS OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY
8224-274381-0000 THOUGH THROWN INTO PRISON FOR THIS ENTERPRISE AND DETAINED SOME TIME HE WAS NOT DISCOURAGED BUT STILL CONTINUED BY HIS COUNTEN AND PROTECTION TO INFUSE SPIRIT INTO THE DISTRESSED ROYALISTS
8224-274381-0001 AMONG OTHER PERSONS OF DISTINCTION WHO UNITED THEMSELVES TO HIM WAS LORD NAPER OF MARCHESTON SON OF THE FAMOUS INVENTOR OF THE LAGERTHMS THE PARSSON TO WHOM THE TITLE OF A GREAT MAN IS MORE JUSTLY DE THAN TO ANY OTHER WHOM HIS COUNTRY EVER PRODUCED
8224-274381-0002 WHILE THE FORMER FORETOLD THAT THE SCOTTISH COON ANDTERS WERE SECRETLY FORMING A UNION WITH THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT AND INCULCATED THE NECESSITY OF PREVENTING THEM BY SOME VIGOROUS UNDERTAKING THE LATTER STILL INSISTED THAT EVERY SUCH ATTEMPT WOULD PRECIPITIT THEM INTO MEASURES TO WHICH OTHERWISE THEY WERE NOT PERHAPS INCLINED
8224-274381-0003 THE KING'S EARS WERE NOW OPENED TO MONTROSES COUNSELS WHO PROPOSED NONE BUT THE BOLDEST AND MOST DARING AGREEABLY TO THE DESPERATE STATE OF THE ROYAL CAALS IN SCOPLAND
8224-274381-0004 FIVE HUNDRED MEEN MORE WHO HAD BEEN LEVIED BY THE COBONANTS WERE PERSUADED TO EMBRACE THE ROYAL COALS AND WITH THIS COMBINED FORCE HE HASTENED TO ATTACK LORD ELKO WHO LAY IT PARTH WITH AN ARMY OF SIX THOUSAND MEN ASSEMBLED UPON THE FIRST NEWS OF THE IRISH INVASION
8224-274381-0005 DREADING THE SUPERIOR POWER OF ARGLE WHO HAVING ENJINED HIS VESSELS TO A FORCE LEVIED BY THE PUBLIC WAS APPROACHING WITH A CONSIDERABLE ARMY MONTROSE HASTENED NORTHWARD IN ORDER TO ROUSE AGAIN THE MOCKCHUEIS OF HUNTLY AND THE GORDENS WHO HAVING BEFORE HASTILY TAKEN ARMS HAD BEEN INSTANTLY SUPPRESSED BY THE COVERN ENS
8224-274381-0006 THIS NOBLEMAN'S CHARACTER THOUGH CELEBRATED FOR POLITICAL COURAGE AND CONDUCT WAS VERY LOW FOR MILITARY PROWESS AND AFTER SOME SKIRMISHES IN WHICH HE WAS WORSTED HE HEAR ALLUOWED MONTROSE TO ESCAPE HIM
8224-274381-0007 BY QUICK MARCHES THROUGH THESE INACCESSIBLE MOUNTAINS THAT GENERAL FREED HIMSELF FROM THE SUPERIOR FORCES OF THE COVNANTS
8224-274381-0008 WITH THESE AND SOME REENFORCEMENTS OF THE ETHLE MEN AND MAN DOMULT'S WHOM HE HAD RECOLD MONTROSE FELL SUDDENLY UPON ARGLE'S COUNTRY AND LET LOOSE UPON IT ALL THE RAGE OF WAR CARRYING OFF THE CATTLE BURNING THE HOUSES AND PUTTING THE INHABITANT TO THE SWORD
8224-274381-0009 THIS SEVERITY BY WHICH MONTROSE SOLIED HIS VICTORIES WAS THE RESULT OF PRIVATE ANIMOSITY AGAINST THE CHIEFTAIN AS MUCH AS A ZEAL FOR THE PUBLIC COALS ARGILE COLLECTING THREE THOUSAND MEN MARCHED IN QUEST OF THE ENEMY WHO HAD RETIRED WITH THEIR PLUUNDER AND HE LAY AT INNERLUCKY SUPPOSING HIMSELF STILL AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM THEM
8224-274381-0010 BY A QUICK AND UNEXPECTED MARCH MONTROSE HASTENED TO IN LOCKY AND PRESENTED HIMSELF IN ORDER OF BATTLE BEFORE THE SURPRISED BUT NOT AFFRIGHTENED COVNANTORS
8224-274381-0011 HIS CONDUCT AND PRESENCE OF MIND IN THISS EMERGS APPEARED CONSPICUOUS
8224-274381-0012 MONTROSE WEAK IN CAVALRY HERE LINED HIS TROOPS OF HORSE WITH INFANTRY AND AFTER PUTTING THE ENEMY'S HORSE TO REOUTE FELL WITH UNITED FORCE UPON THEIR FOOT WHO WERE ENTIRELY CUT IN PIECES THOUGH WITH THE LOSS OF THE GALLANT LORD GORDEN ON THE PART OF THE ROYALISTS
8224-274381-0013 FROM THE SAME MEN NEW REGIMENTS AND NEW COMPANIES WERE FORMED DIFFERENT OFFICERS APPOINTED AND THE WHOLE MILITARY FORCE PUT INTO SUCH HANDS AS THE INDEPENDENCE COULD RELI OWN
8224-274381-0014 BESIDES MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT WHO WERE EXCLUDED MANY OFFICERS UNWILLING TO SERVE UNDER THE NEW GENERALS THREW UP THEIR COMMISSIONS ANDNWARILY FACILITATED THE PROJECT OF PUTTING THE ARMY ENTIRLY INTO THE HANDS OF THAT FACTION
8224-274381-0015 THAT THE DISCIPLINE OF THE FORMER PLIAMENTARY ARMY WAS NOT CONTEMPTIBLE A MORE EXACT PLAN WAS INTRODUCED AND RIGOROUSLY EXECUTED BY THESE NEW COMMANDDERS
8224-274381-0016 VALOR INDEED WAS VERY GENERALLY DIFFUSED OVER THE ONE PARTY AS WELL AS THE OTHER DURING THIS PERIOD DISCIPLILNE ALSO WAS ATTAINED BY THE FORCES OF THE PARLIAMENT BUT THE PERFECTION OF THE MILITARY AUNT IN CONCERTING THE GENERAL PLANS OF ACTION AND THE OPERATIONS OF THE FIELD SEEMS STILL ON BOTH SIDES TO HAVE BEEN IN A GREAT MEASURE WANTING
8224-274381-0017 HISTORIANS AT LEAST PERHAPS FROM THEIR OWN IGNORANCE AND INEXPERIENCE HAVE NOT REMARK'D ANY THING BUT A HEADLO LONG IMPETUOUS CONDUCT EACH PARTY HURRYING TO A BATTLE WHERE VALOR UN FORTUNE CHIEFLY DETERMINED THE SUCCESS
8224-274384-0000 HE PASSED THROUGH HENY SIN ALBANES AND CAME SO NEARERS AT LONDON AS HARROW ON THE HILL
8224-274384-0001 THE SCOTTISH GENERALS AND COMMISSION IS AFFECTED GREAT SURPRISE ON THE APPEARANCE OF THE KING AND THOUGH THEY PAID HIM ON THE EXTERIOR RESPECT DUE TO HIS DIGNITY THEY INSTANTLY SET A GOD UPON HIM UNDER COLOR OF PROTECTION AND MADE HIM IN REALITY A PRISONER
8224-274384-0002 THEY INFORMED THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT OF THIS UNEXPECTED INCIDENT AND ASSURED THEM THAT THEY HAD ENTERED INTO NO PRIVATE TREATY WITH THE KING
8224-274384-0003 OR HATH HE GIVEN US ANY GIFT
8224-274384-0004 AND THE MEN OF ISRAIL AUNSER THE MEN OF JUDA AND SAID WE HAVE TEN PARTS IN THE KING AND WE HAVE ALSO MORE RIGHT IN DAVID THAN YE WHY THEN DID  DESPISE US THAT OUR ADVICE SHOULD NOT BE FIRST HAD IN BRINGING BACK OUR KING
8224-274384-0005 ANOTHER PREACHER OF REPROACHING HIM TO HIS FACE WITH HIS MISCOVERNMENT ORDERED THIS SOM TO BE SUNG
8224-274384-0006 THE KING STOOD UP AND COLD FOR THAT SOM WHICH BEGINS WITH THESE WORDS
8224-274384-0007 HAVE MERCY LORD ON ME I PRAY FOR MEN WOULD ME DEVOUR
8224-274384-0008 THE GOOD NATURED ORDIANS IN PITY TO FALLEN MAJESTY SHOWED FOR ONE GREATER DEFERENCE TO THE KING THAN TO THE MINISTER AND SUNG THE SOM WHICH THE FORMER HAD COLD FOR
8224-274384-0009 THE PARLIAMENT AND THE DISCOTS LAT THEIR PROPOSALS BEFORE THE KING
8224-274384-0010 BEFORE THE SETTLEMENT OF TERMS THE ADMINISTRATION MUST BE POSSESSED ENTIRLY BY THE PARLIAMENTS OF BOTH KINGDOMS AND HOW IN COMPATIBLE THAT SCHEME WITH THE LIBERTY OF THE KING IS EASILY IMAGINED
8224-274384-0011 THE ENGLISH IT IS EVIDENT HAD THEY NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY ASSURED OF RECEIVING THE KING WOULD NEVER HAVE PART IT WITH SO CONSIDERABLE ASM AND WHILE THEY WEAKENED THEMSELVES BY THE SAME MEASURE HAVE STRENGTHENPEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY MUST OFWARDS HAVE SO MATERIAL AND INTEREST TO DISCUSS
8224-274384-0012 IF ANY STILL RETAINED RANK ARE AGAINST HIM IN HIS PRESENT CONDITION THEY PAUSSED IN SILENCE WHILE HIS WELL WISHERS MORE GENEROUS THAN PRUDENT ACCOMPAN EIAT HIS MACH WITH TEARS WITH THATCLAMATIONS AND WITH PRAYERS FOR HIS SAFETY
8224-274384-0013 HIS DEATH IN DISCONJUNCTURE WAS A PUBLIC MISFORTUNE
8230-279154-0000 THE ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE WILL OCCUPY US UNTIL THE END OF THE THIRTEENTH LECTURE AND IS THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF OUR WHOLE ENTERPRISE
8230-279154-0001 WHAT HA IS CALLED PERCEPTION DIFFERS FROM SENSATION BY THE FACT THAT THE SENSATIONAL INGREDIENTS BRING UP HABITUAL ASSOCIATES IMAGES AN EXPECTATIONS OF THEIR USUAL CORRELLETS ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECTIVELY INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE SENSATION
8230-279154-0002 WHETHER OR NOT THIS PRINCIPLE IS LIABLE TO EXCEPTIONS EVERY ONEE WOULD AGREE THAT IT HAS A BROAD MEASURE OF TRUTH THOUGH THE WORD EXACTLY MIGHT SEEMEN OVER STATEMENT AND IT MIGHT SEEM MORE CORRECT TO SAY THAT IDAS A PROXIMICLY REPRESENT IMPRESSIONS
8230-279154-0003 AND WHAT A SORT OF EVIDENCE ISLOGICALLY POSSIBLE
8230-279154-0004 THERE IS NO LOGICAL IMPOSSIBILITY AND THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE WORLD SPRANG INTO BEING FIVE MINUTES AGO EXACTLY AS IT THEN WAS WITH THE POPULATION THAT REMEMBERED WHOLLY UNRELL PASSED
8230-279154-0005 ALL THAT I'M DOING IS TO USE ITSLUGICAL TENABILITY AS A HELP IN THE ANALYSIS OF WHAT OCCURS WHEN WE REMEMBER
8230-279154-0006 THE BEHAVIOORIST TO ATTEMPTS TO MAKE PSYCHOLOGY A RECORD OF BEHAVIOUR HAS TO TRUST HIS MEMORY IN MAKING THE RECORD
8230-279154-0007 HABIT IS A CONCEPT INVOLVING THE OCCURRENCE OF SIMILAR EVENTS AT DIFFERENT TIMES IF THE BAHAVIORIST FILLS CONFIDENT BET THERE IS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS HABIT THAT CAN ONLY BE BECAUSE HE TRUST HIS MEMORY WHEN IT ASSURES HIM THAT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER TIMES
8230-279154-0008 BUT I DO NOT THINK SUCH AN EFFERENCE IS WARRANTED
8230-279154-0009 OUR CONFIDENCE OR LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE ACCURACY OF A MEMORY IMAGE MUST INFUNDAMENTAL CASES BE BASED UPON A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE IMAGE ITSELF SENCE WE CANNOT EVOKE THE PAST BODILY AND COMPARE IT WITH THE PRESENT IMAGE
8230-279154-0010 WE SOMETIMES HAVE IMAGES THAT ARE BNULOMANS PECULIARLY VAGUE WHICH YET WE DO NOT TRUST FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF FATIGUE WE MAY SEE A FR'S FACE VIVIDLY AND CLEARLY BUT HORRIBLY DISTORTED
8230-279154-0011 SOME IMAGES LIKE SOME SENSATIONS FELL VERY FAMILIAR WHILE OTHERS FILL STRANGE
8230-279154-0012 FAMILIARITY IS A FILLING CAPABLE OF DEGREEES
8230-279154-0013 IN AN IMAGE OF A WELL KNOWN FACE FOR EXAMPLE SOME PARTS MAY FEIEL MORE FAMILIAR THAN OTHERS WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE HAVE MORE BELIEF IN THE ACCURACY OF THE FAMILIAR PARTS THAN IN THAT OF THE UNFAMMILIAR PARTS
8230-279154-0014 I COME NOW TO THE OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MEMORY IMAGES MUST HAVE IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
8230-279154-0015 THEY MUST HAVE SOME CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MAKES US REGARD THEM AS REFERRING TO MORE OR LESS REMOTE PORTIONS OF THE PAST
8230-279154-0016 IN ACTUAL FACT THERE ARE DOUBTLESS VARIOUS FACTORS THAT CONCUR IN GIVING US THE FILLING OF GREATER OR LESS REMOTENESS IN SOME REMEMBERED EVEN IT
8230-279154-0017 THERE MAY BE A SPECIFIC FILLING WHICH COULD BE CALLED THE FILLING OF PASTNESS ESPECIALLY WERE IMMEDIATE MEMORY IS CONCERNED
8230-279154-0018 THERE IS OF COURSE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNOWING THE TEMPORAL RELATION OF A REMEMBEREDFENT TO THE PRESENT AND KNOWING THE TIME ORDER OF TO REMEMBERED EVENTS
8230-279154-0019 IT WOULD SEEM THAT ONLY RATHER RECENT EVENTS CAN BE PLACED AT ALL ACCURATELY BY MEANS OF FEELINGS GIVING THEIR TEMPORAL RELATION TO THE PRESENT BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT SUCH FILLINGS MUST PLAY AN ESSENTIAL PART IN THE PROCESS OF DTING REMEMBERED AD EVENTS
8230-279154-0020 IF WE HAD RETAINED THE SUBJECT OR ACT IN KNOWLEDGE THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF MEMORY WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPARATIVELY SIMPLE
8230-279154-0021 REMEMBERING HAS TO BE A PRESENT OCCURRENTS IN SOME WAY RESEMBLING OR LATED TOO WHAT IS REMEMBERED
8230-279154-0022 SOME POINTS MAY BE TAKEN AS FIXED AND SUCH AS ANY THEORY OF MEMORY MUST ARRIVE AT
8230-279154-0023 IN THIS CASE AS IN MOST OTHERS WHAT MAY BE TAKEN A CERTAIN IN ADVANCE IS RATHERVEE
8230-279154-0024 THE FIRST OF OUR VAGUE BUT INDUBIDABLE DATA IS THAT THERE IS KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
8230-279154-0025 WE MIGHT PROVISIONALLY THOUGH PERHAPS NOT QUITE CORRECTLY DEFINE MEMORY AS THAT WAY OF KNOWING ABOUT THE PAST WHICH HAS NO ANAALGUE IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE FUTURE SUCH A EFENITION WOULD AT LEAST SERVED TO MARK THE PROBLEM WITH WHICH WE ARE CONCERNED THOUGHOE SOME EXPECTATIONS MAY DESERVE TOYRNK WITH MEMORY AS REGARDS IMMEDIACY
8230-279154-0026 THIS DISTINCTION IS VITAL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF MEMORY BUT IT IS NOT SO EASY TO CARRY OUT PRACTICE AS IT IS TO DRAW IN THEORY
8230-279154-0027 A GRAMMAPHONE BY THE HELP OF SUITABLE RECORDS MIGHT RELATE TO US THE INCIDENTS OF ITS PASSED AND PEOPLE ARE NOT SO DIFFERENT FROM GRAMAFHS AS THEY LIKE TO BELIEVE
8230-279154-0028 I CAN SET TO WORK NOW TO REMEMBER THINGS I NEVER REMEMBERED BEFORE SUCH AS WHAT I HAD TO EAT FOR BREAKFAST THIS MORNING AND IT CAN HARDLY BE WHOLLY HABIT THAT ENABLES ME TO DO THIS
8230-279154-0029 THE FACT THAT A MAN CAN RECITE A POEM DOES NOT SHOW THAT HE REMEMBERS ANY PREVIOUS OCCASION ON WHICH HE HAS RECIT IT OR READ IT
8230-279154-0030 SEIMON'S TO BOOKS MENTIONED IN AN EARLIER LUCTURE DO NOT TOUCH KNOWLEDGE MEMENTORY AT ALL CLOSELY
8230-279154-0031 THEY GIVE LAWLLS ACCORDING TO WHICH IMAGES OF PASS OCCURRENTSS COME INTO OUR MINDS BUT DO NOT DISCUSS OUR BELIEF THAT THESE IMAGES REFER TO PASS OCCURRENCES WHICH IS WHAT CONSTITUTES KNOWLEDGE MEMORY
8230-279154-0032 IT IS THIS THAT IS OF INTEREST TO THEOR OF KNOWLEDGE
8230-279154-0033 IT IS BY NO MEANS ALWAYS RE LIABLE ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS AT SOME TIME EXPERIENCED THE WELL KNOWN ILLUSION THAT ALL THAT HAS HAPPENING NOW HAPPENED BEFORE AT SOME TIME
8230-279154-0034 WHENEVER THE SENSE OF FAMILIARITY OCCURS WITHOUT A DEFINITE OBJECT IT LEAS US TO SEARCH THE ENVIRONMENT UNTIL WE ARE SATISFY THAT WE HAVE FOUND THE APPROPRIATE OBJECT WHICH LEADS US TO THE JUDGMENT THIS IS FAMILIAR
8230-279154-0035 THUS NO KNOWLEDGE AS TO THE PAST IS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE FILLING OF FAMILIARITY ALONE
8230-279154-0036 A FURTHER STAGE IS RECOGNITION
8230-279154-0037 RECOGNITION IN THIS SENS DOES NOT NECESSARILY INVOLVEORE THAT A HABIT OF ASSOUSIATION THE KIND OF OBJECT WE ARE SEEING AT THE MOMENT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORD CAT OR WITH AN OUDITORY IMAGE OF PURN OR WHATEVER OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WE MAY HAPPEN TO RECOGNIZE IN THE CAT OF THE MOMENT
8230-279154-0038 WE ARE OF COURSE IN FACT ABLE TO JUDGE WHEN WE RECOGNIZE AN OBJECT THAT WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE BUT THIS JUDGMENT IS SOMETHING OVER AN ABOVE RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE AND MAY VERY PROBABLY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ANIMALS THAT NEVERTHELESS HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE OF THE WORD
8230-279154-0039 THIS KNOWLEDGE IS MEMORY IN ONE SENCEE THOUGH AN ANOTHER IT IS NOT
8230-279154-0040 THERE ARE HOWEVER SEVERAL POINTS IN WHICH SUCH AN ACCOUNT OF RECOGNITION IS INADEQUATE TO BEGIN WITH IT MIGHT SEEM AT FIRST SOUGHT MORE CORRECT TO DEFINE RECOGNITION AS I HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE THAN AS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE
8230-279154-0041 THE DEFINITION OF MY EXPERIENCE IS DIFFICULT BROADLY SPEAKING IT IS EVERYTHING THAT IS CONNECTED WITH WHAT I AM EXPERIENCING NOW BY CERTAIN LENCS OF WHICH THE VARIOUS FORMS OF MEMORY A ARE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT
8230-279154-0042 THUS IF I RECOGNIZE A THING THE OCCASION OF ITS PREVIOUS EXISTENCE IN VIRTUE OF WHICH I RECOGNIZE IT FORMS PART OF MY EXPERIENCE BY DEFINITION THE RECOGNITION WILL BE ONE OF THE MARKS BY WHICH MY EXPERIENCE IS SINGLEED OUT FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD
8230-279154-0043 OF COURSE THE WORDS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE ARE A VERY INADEQUATE TRANSLATION OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHEN WE FORM A JUDGMENT OF RECOGNITION BUT THAT IS UNAVOIDABLE WORDS ARE FRAMED TO EXPRESS A LEVEL THOUGHT WHICH IS NO MEAN'S PRIMATIVE AND ARE QUITE INCAPABLE OF EXPRESSING SUCH AN ALEMENTARY OCCURRENCE AS RECOGNITION
8455-210777-0000 I REMAINED THERE ALONE FOR MANY HOURS BUT I MUST ACKNOWLEDOWGE THAT BEFORE I LEFT THE CHAMBERS I HAD GRADUALLY BROUGHT MYSELF TO LOOK AT THE MATTER IN ANOTHER LIGHT
8455-210777-0001 HAD EVER CRESWELLER NOT BEEN GOOD LOOKING HAD JACK BEEN STILL A COLLEGE HAD SIR KENINGTONVLE REMAINED IN ENGLAND HAD MISTER BUNNNEITT AND THE BARKEEPER NOT SUCCEEDED AND STOPPING MY CARRIAGE ON THE HILL SHOULD I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN A RADING FOR THE FINE ON THE PTURE OF MY OLD FRIEND
8455-210777-0002 ON ARRIVAY AT HOME AT MY OWN RESIDENCE I FOUND THAT ARCHALON WAS FILLED WITH A BRILLIANT COMPANY
8455-210777-0003 AS I SPOKE I MADE HIM A GRACIOUS BOW AND I THINK I SHOWED HIM BY MY MODE OF ADDRESS THAT I DID NOT BEAR ANY GRUDGE AS TO MY INDIVIDUAL SELF
8455-210777-0004 I HAVE COME TO YOUR SUURES MISTER PRESIDENT WITH THE PURPOSE OF SEEING HOW THINGS ARE PROGRESSING IN THIS DISIN QUARTER OF THE WORLD
8455-210777-0005 WE HAVE OUR LITTLE STRUGGLES HERE IS ELSEWHERE AND ALL THINGS CANNOT BE DONE BY ROSE WAR
8455-210777-0006 WE ARE QUITE SATISFIED NOW CAPTAIN BATTLE AAXE SAID MY WIFE
8455-210777-0007 QUITE SATISFIED SAID EV
8455-210777-0008 THE LADIES IN COMPLIANCE WITH THAT SOFTNESS OF HOROR WHICH IS THEIR CHARACTERISTIC ARE ON ONE SIDE AND THE MEN BY WHOM THE WORLD HAS TO BE MANAGED ARE ON THE OTHER
8455-210777-0009 NO DOUBT PROOCESES OF TIME THE LADIES WILL FOLLOW
8455-210777-0010 THEIR MASTER SAID MISSUS NEVER BEEN
8455-210777-0011 I DID NOT MEAN SAID CAPTAIN BATTALGS THE TOUCH OF PON PUBLIC SUBJECTS AT SUCH A MOMENT AS THIS
8455-210777-0012 MISSUS NEVER BEEN YOU MUST INDEED BE PROUD OF YOUR SON
8455-210777-0013 JACK HAD BEEN STANDING IN THE FOARUR CORNER OF THE ROOM TALKING TO EV AND WAS NOW REDUCED A SILENCE BY HIS PRAISES
8455-210777-0014 SIR KENINGTON OVAL IS A VERY FINE PLAYER SAID MY WIFE
8455-210777-0015 I AND MY WIFE AND SON AND THE TWO CRRESSWELLERS AND THREE OR FOUR OTHERS AGREED TO DINEE ON BOARD THE SHIP ON THE NEXT
8455-210777-0016 THIS I FLLT WAS PAY TO ME AS BEING PRESIDENT OTHER REPUBLIC AND I ENDEAVOURED TO BEHAVE MYSELF WITH SUCH MINGLED HUMILITY AND DIGNITY AS MIGHT BE FIT THE OCCASION BUT I COULD NOT A FEEL THAT SOMETHING WAS WANTING TO THE SIMPLICITY OF MY ORDINARY LIFE
8455-210777-0017 MY WIFE ON THE SPUR THE MOMENT MANAGED TO GIVE THE GENTLEMEN A VERY GOOD DINNER
8455-210777-0018 THIS SHE SAID WAS TRUE HOSPITALITY AND I AM NOT SURE THAT I DID NOT AGREE WITH THERE
8455-210777-0019 THEN THERE WERE THREE OR FOUR LEADING MEN OF THE COMMUNITY WITH THEIR WIVES WHO WERE FOR THE MOST PART THE FATHERS AND MOTHERS OF THE YOUNG LADIES
8455-210777-0020 OH YES SAID JACK AND I'M NOWHERE
8455-210777-0021 BUT I MEAN TO HAVE MY INNINGS BEFORE A LONG
8455-210777-0022 OF WHAT MISSUS NEVER BEEN HAD GONE THROUGH IN PROVIDING BIRDS BEASTS AND FISHES NOT TO TALK OF TARTS AND JELLYIES FOR THE DINNER OF THAT DAY NO ONE BUT MYSELF CAN HAVE ANY IDEA BUT IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT SHE ACCOMPLISHED HER TASK WITH THOROUGH SUCCESS
8455-210777-0023 WE SAT WITH THE OFFICER SOME LITTLE TIME AFTER DINNER AND THEN WENT A SHORE
8455-210777-0024 HOW MUCH OF EVIL OF REAL ACCOMPLISHED EVIL HAD THERE NOT OCCURRED TO ME DRIN THE LAST FEW DAYS
8455-210777-0025 WE WHATLL COULD I DO NOW BUT JUST LAY MYSELF DOWN AND DIE
8455-210777-0026 AND THE DEATH OF WHICH I DREAMT COULD NOT ALAS
8455-210777-0027 WHEN THIS CAPTAIN SHOULD HAVE TAKEN HIMSELF AND AS VESSEL BACK TO ENGLAND I WOULD RETIRE TO A SMALL FORM WHICH I POSSESSED AT THE FURTHER'S SIDE OF THE ISLAND AND THERE AND SECLUSION WOULD I END MY DAYSE
8455-210777-0028 JACK WOULD BECOME EVEN IS HAPPY HUSBAND AND WOULD REMAIN AMST THE HURRIED DUTIES OF THE EAGER WORLD
8455-210777-0029 THINKING OF ALL THIS I WENT TO SLEEP
8455-210777-0030 MISTER NEVER BEEN BEGAN THE CAPTAIN AND I OBSERVED THAT UP TO THAT MOMENT HE HAD GENERALLY ADDRESSED ME AS PRESIDENT IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT WE HAVE COME HERE ON AN UNPLEASANT MISSION
8455-210777-0031 YOU HAVE RECEIVED US WITH ALL THAT CURTSINGAN HOSPITALITY FOR WHICH YOUR CHARACTER IN IN ENGLAND STAND SO HIGH
8455-210777-0032 IT IS A DUTY SAID I

8455-210777-0039 I CAN ASSURE YOU HE HAS NOT EVEN ALLOWED ME TO SEE THE TRIGGER SINCE I HAVE BEEN ON BORE
8455-210777-0040 THEN SAID SIRF FERINANDO THERE' IS NOTHING FOR IT BUT THAT WE MUST TAKE YOU WITH HIM
8455-210777-0041 THERE CAME UPON ME A SUDDEN SHOCK WHEN I HEARD THESE WORDS WHICH EXCEEDED ANYTHING WHICH I HAD YET FELL
