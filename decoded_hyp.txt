1089-134686-0000 HE HOPED THERE WOULD BE STOEO FOR DINNER TURNIPS AND KTS AND BRISED POTATOES AND FAT MUON PIECES TO BE LATLED OUT IN THE THICK PEPPARD FLOWER FAT SAUCE
1089-134686-0001 STUFFID INTO YOU HIS BELLY COUNCELED HIM
1089-134686-0002 AFTER EARLY NIGHT FALL THE YELLOW LAMPSE WOULD LIGHT HA UPP HERE AND THERE THE SQUALID QUARTER OF THE BRAFLELLS
1089-134686-0003 HOW BURTY AND ANY GOOD IN YOUR MIND
1089-134686-0004 NUMBERTEN FRESH NELLS WAITING ON YOU COULD NOT HUSBAND
1089-134686-0005 THE MUSIC CAME NEARER AND HE RECALLED THE WORDS THE WORDS OF SHELLIES FRAGMENT UPON THE MOON WANDERING COMPANIONLESS PALE FOR WEEARNESS
1089-134686-0006 THE DLL LIGHT FELL MORE FAINTLY UPON THE PAGE WHERE ON ANOTHER REQUATION BEGAN TO ONEFOLD ITSELF SLOWLY AND TO SPREAD A BROAD ITS WIDENING TAIL
1089-134686-0007 A COLD LUSID INDIFFERENCE REIGNED IN HIS SOUL
1089-134686-0008 THE CHAOSS AND WHICH HIS ARDOR EXTINGUISH ITSELF WAS A COLD INDIFFERENT KNOWLEDGE OF HIMSELF
1089-134686-0009 AT MOST BY AN ALMS GIVEN TO A BEGGAR WHOSE BLESSING HE FLED FROM HE MIGHT HOPE WEARILY TO WIN FOR HIMSELF SOME MEASURE OF ACTUAL GRACE
1089-134686-0010 WELL NOW IN IS I DECLARE YOU HAVE A HEAD AND SO HAS MY STICK
1089-134686-0011 ON SATURDAY MORNINGS WHEN THE SODALITY MET IN THE CHAPEL TO RECIT THE LITTLE OFFICE HIS PLACE WAS AQUSHIONED KNEING DESK AT THE RIGHT OF THE ALTERAR FROM WHICH HE LED HIS WING OF BOIC THROUGH THE RESPONSS
1089-134686-0012 HER EYES SEEMED TO REGARD HIM WITH MILD PITY HER HONESS A STRANGE LIGHT BLOWING FAINTLY UPON HER FRAIL FLESH DID NOT HUMILI THE SINNER WHO APPROACHED HER
1089-134686-0013 IFEVER HE WAS IMPELLED TO CASTS SIN FROM HIM AND TO REPEN THE IMPULSE THAT MOVED HIM WAS THE WISH TO BE HER NIGHT
1089-134686-0014 HE TRIED TO THINK HOW IT COULD BE
1089-134686-0015 BUT THE DUSK DEEPENING IN THE SCHOOL ROOM COVERED OVER HIS THOUGHTS THE BELL RANG
1089-134686-0016 THEN YOU CAN ASK HIM QUESTIONS ON THE CATICIS EM DEADLOOLUS
1089-134686-0017 STEPHEN LEANING BACK AND DRAWING EDLY ON HIS SCRIBBLER LISTENED TO THE TALK ABOUT HIM WHICHIRAN CHECKED FROM TIME TO TIME BY SAYING
1089-134686-0018 IT WAS STRANGE TO THAT HE FOUND AN D PLEASURE IN FOLLOWING UP TO THE END THE RIDIGID LINES OF THE DOCTRINES OF THE CHURCH AND PENETRATING INTO OBSECURE SILENCES ONLY TO HEAR AND FEEL THE MORE DEEPTLY HIS OWN CONDEMNATION
1089-134686-0019 THE SENTENCE OF SAINT JAMES WHICH SAYS THAT HE WHO OFFENDS AGAINST ONE COMMANDMENT BECOMES GUILTY OF ALL HAD SEEMED TO HIM FIRST A SWOLL AND PHRASE UNTIL HE HAD BEGUN TO GROP IN THE DARKNESS OF HIS OWN STATE
1089-134686-0020 IF A MAN HAD STOOL ON A POUND IN HIS YOUTH AND HAD USED THAT POUND TO A MASS AE HUGE FORTUNE HOW MUCH WAS HE OBLIGED TO BE GIVE BACK THE POUND HE HAD STOL AND ONLY OR THE POUND TOGETHER WITH THE COMPOUND INTEREST A CRUWING UPON IT OR ALL HIS HUGE FORTUNE
1089-134686-0021 IF A LAMON AND GIVING BACKPTISM POOR THE WATER BEFORE SAYING THE WORDS IS THE CHILD BAP TZED
1089-134686-0022 HOW COMES IT THAT WHILE THE FIRST BE ATTITUDE PROMISES THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN TO THE POOR OF HEART THE SECOND BE ATTITUDE PROMISES ALSO TO THE MEK THAT THEY SHALL POSSESS THE LAND
1089-134686-0023 WHY WAS THE SACRAMENT OF THE EUUORIST INSTITUTED UNDER THE TWO SPECIES OF BREAD AND WINE IF JESUS CHRIST BE PRESENT BODY AND BLOOD SO AND DIVINITY IN THE BREAD ALONE AND IN THE WINE ALONE
1089-134686-0024 IF THE WINE CHANGE INTO  VINICIGER AND THE HOST CRUMBLE INTO CORUPTION AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN CONSECRAATED IS JESUS CHRIST TO STILL PRESENT UNDER THEIR SPECIES AS GOD AND AS MAN
1089-134686-0025 A GENTLE KICK FROM THE TALL BOY IN THE BENCH BEHIND URGED STEPHEN TO ASKET DIFFICULT QUESTION
1089-134686-0026 THE RECTOR DID NOT ASK FOR A CATICISM TO HEAR THE LESSON FROM
1089-134686-0027 HE CLASPED HIS HANDS ON THE DSK AND SAID
1089-134686-0028 THE RETREAT WILL BEGIN ON WEDDNES DAY AFTERNON IN HONOOR OF SAINT FRANANCESZVIOUR WHOSE FEAST DAY IS SATURDAY
1089-134686-0029 ON FDA CONFESSION WILL BE HEARD ALL THE AFTERNOON AFTER BEADS
1089-134686-0030 BEW OF MAKING THAT MISTAKE
1089-134686-0031 STEPHEN'S HEART BEGAN SLOWLY TO FOLD AND FAD WITH FEAR LIKE A WING FLOWER
1089-134686-0032 HE HAS CALLED AS YOU KNOW THE APOSSEL OF THE INDIES
1089-134686-0033 A GREAT SAINT SAINT FRCISZVIUR
1089-134686-0034 THE RECTOR PAWUSED AND THEN SHAKING HIS CLASPP TO HANDS BEFORE HIM WENT ON
1089-134686-0035 HE HAD THE FAITH IN HIM THAT MOVE S MOUNTAINS
1089-134686-0036 A GREAT SINT SAINT FRANANCES ZVIOUR
1089-134686-0037 IN THE SILENCE THEIR DARK FIRE KINDL THE DUSK INTO A TWONNY GLOW
1089-134691-0000 HE COULD WAITE NO LONGER
1089-134691-0001 FOR A FULL HOUR HE HAD PACED UP AND DOWN WAITING BUT HE COULD WAIT NO LONGER
1089-134691-0002 HE SET OFF OFBUPTLY FOR THE BOW WALKING RAPIDLY LELESS HIS FATHER SHRILL WHISTLED MIGHT CALLED HIM BACK AND IN A FEW MOMENTS HE HAD ROUNDED THE CURVE AT THE POLICE SPARCK AND WAS SAFE
1089-134691-0003 THE UNIVERSITY
1089-134691-0004 BRIDE AFTER SATISFACTION UPLIFTED HIM LIKE LONG SLOW WAVES
1089-134691-0005 WHOSE FE AS THE FEET OF HEARTS AND UNDERNEATH THE EVERLASTING ARMS
1089-134691-0006 THE PRIDE OF THAT DIM IMAGE BROUGHT BACK TO HIS MIND THE DIGNITY OF THE OFFIC HE HAD REFUSED
1089-134691-0007 SOON THE WHOLE BRIDGE WAS TREMBLING AND RESOUNDING
1089-134691-0008 THE UNCUTH FACES PASS HIM TO BY TWO STAN YELLOW OR RED OR LIVE IT BY THE SEA AND AS HE STROVE TO LOOK AT THEM WITH EASE AND INDIFFERENCE A FAINT STAIN OF PERSONAL SHAME AND COMMISERATION ROSE TO HIS OWN FACE
1089-134691-0009 ANDRY WITH HIMSELF HE TRIED TO HHE HIS FACE FROM THEIR EYES BY GAZING DOWN SIDEWAYS INTO THE SHALLOW SWIRLING WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE BUT HE STILL SAW REFLECTION THEIRIN OF THEIR TOP HEAVY SILCTS AND HUMBLE TAPE LIKE COLLARS AND LOOSSTLY HANGING CLEARICAL CLOTHES BROTHER HICKY
1089-134691-0010 BROTHER MA CARARDEL BROTHER KE OF
1089-134691-0011 THEIR PETY WOULD BE LIKE THEIR NAMES LIKE THEIR FACES LIKE THEIR CLOTHES AND WAS IDLE FOR HIM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT THEIR HUMBLE AND CONTRIED HEARTS IT MIGHT BE PAID OF FAR RICHAR TRIBUTE DE DEVOTION THAN HIS HAD EVER BEEN A GIFT TENFOLD MORE ACCEPTIBLE THAN HIS ELABARATE ADTERATION
1089-134691-0012 IT WAS IDLE FOR HIM TO MOVE HIMSELF TO BE GENEROUS TOWARDS THEM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT IF HE EVER CAME TO THEIR GATES STRIPPED OF HIS BRDE BEATEON AND IN BEGGARS WEEDS THAT THEY WOULD BE GENEROUS TOWARDS HIM LOVING HIM AS THEMSELVES
1089-134691-0013 IDLE AND EBITTERING FINALLY TO ARGUE AGAINST HIS OWN DISPASSIONATE CURITUDE THAT THE COMMANDMENT OF LOVE BE US NOT TO LOVE OUR NEIGHBOORUR AS OURSELVES WITH THE SAME A MOUNT AND INTENSITY OF LOVE BUT TO LOVE HIM AS OURSELVES WITH THE SAME KIND OF LOVE
1089-134691-0014 THE PHRASE AND THE DAY AND THE SCENE HARMONIZED IN A CHORD
1089-134691-0015 WORDS WAS IT THEIR COLORS
1089-134691-0016 THEY WEREVOYGING ACROSS THE DESERTS OF THE SKY A HOST OF NO MADS ON THE MARCH VOYGING HIGH OVER IRELAND WESTWARD BOUND
1089-134691-0017 THE EUROPE THEY HAD COME FROM LAY OUT THERE BEYOND THE IRRACY EUROPE OF STRANGE TONGUES AND VALLIED AND WOULD BE GIR AND CIT DEAL AND OF ENTRENCHED AND MARTHED RACES
1089-134691-0018 AGAIN AGAIN
1089-134691-0019 A VOICE FROM BEYOND THE WORLD WAS CALLING
1089-134691-0020 LLOS STEFFENS HERE COMES THE DEELAS
1089-134691-0021 THEIR DVING STONE POISED ON ITS ROD SUPPORTS AND ROCKING UNDER THEIR PLUNGES AND THE ROUGH HUM STONES OF THE SLOPING BREAK WATER OVER WHICH THEY SCRAMBLED IN THEIR HORSE PLAY GLEAMED WITH COLD WETH LUSTTER
1089-134691-0022 HE STOOD STILL INDEFFERENCE TO THEIR CALLS AND PRIED THEIR BANTER WITH EASY WORDS
1089-134691-0023 IT WAS A PAIN TO SEE THEM AND A SWORD LIKE PAIN TO SEE THE SIGNS OF AD ESENCE THAT MADE REPEALENT THEIR PITIABLE NAKEDNESS
1089-134691-0024 STEPFINSSTAD LOS
1089-134691-0025 A MOMENT BEFORE THE GHOST OF THE ANCIENT KINGDOM OF THE DINS HAD LOOKED FORTH THROUGH THE VESTURE OF THEZ WRAFPED CITY
1188-133604-0000 YOU WILL FINAL ME CONTINUALLY SPEAKING OF FORMENN TITION HOLEBIN TNER ANTON CUT AT IN ALMOST THE SAME CHARMS
1188-133604-0001 THE UNIT EVERY QUALITY AND SOMETEIMT YOU WILL FINNY REFRIED TO THEM MISS COLOORISTS SOMETIMESS C SCURIOUSS
1188-133604-0002 BY BEING STUDIOUS OF COLOOR THEY ARE STUDIOUS OF DIVISION ANDHIL THE CURCURIOUS DEVOTES HIMSELF TO THE REPRESENTATION OF DEGREES OF FORCE IN ONE THING ON SEPARATED LIGHT THE COORISTSS HAVE FOR THEIR FUNCTION THE ITTAINMENT OF BEAUTY BY RANGEMENT OF THE DIVISIONS OF LIGHT
1188-133604-0003 MY FIRST PRINCIPAL REASON WAS THAT THEY INFORCED BEYOND ALL RESISTANCE ON ANY STUD IN WHO MIGHT TOTEMPT TO COPY THEM THIS METHOD OF LENRTIONS OF DISTINCT HU SIDE BYSIDEN
1188-133604-0004 SOME OF THE TOUCHES INDEED WHEN THE TENTT HAAS BEEN MIXED WITH MUCH WATER HAVE BEEN LAID AND LITTLE DROPS ARE PONDS SO THAT THE PGMENT MIGHT CRYSTALZ HARARD AT THE EDGE
1188-133604-0005 DOES THE HEAD OF APPART THE LITTLE FLOWER IN HIS BEAK FROM A PICTURE OF KPOSIS ONE OF HIS SERIES OF THE LIFE OF SAINT GEORGE
1188-133604-0006 THEN HE COMES TO THE BEAK OF IT
1188-133604-0007 THE BROWN GROUND BENEATH HIS LEFT FOR THE MOST PN ONE TOUCH OF BLACK AS PUT FOR THE HOLLOW TO DELK AT LINES OF DARK GY FIND THE OUTERCURVE AND ONE LITTLE QUIVERING TOUCH OF WHITE DWSY INNER EDGE OF THE MANDABLE
1188-133604-0008 FOR BELIEVE ME THE FUN OF P FILOSOPHYE OF ART CAN ONLY RATIFY THEIR OPINION THAT THE BEAUTY OF A CO ROBINS TO BE READ AND OF A GRASPLOT TO BE GREEN AND THE BEST SKILL ART IS AN INSTANTLY SEIZING ON THE MANIFUL DELICIOUSNESS OF LIGHT WHICH YOU CAN ONLY SEZ BY PRECISION OF INANT TANEOUS TOUCH
1188-133604-0009 NA YOU WILL SEEN THESE STUDIES THAT THE MOMENT THE WHITEES EN CLOSED PROPERLY AND HARMONZED WITH THE OTHER HUS IT BECOME SOMEHOW MORE PRECIOUS AND PEARLY THAN THE WHITE PAPER AND THAT I AM NOT AFRAID DE LEAVE A WHOLE FIELD OF UNTREATED WHITE PAPER ALL ROUND IT BEING SURE THAT EVEN THE LITTLE DIAMONDS IN THE ROUND WINDOW WILL TELL IS JEWELS IT THEIR GDATED JUSTLY
1188-133604-0010 BUT IN THISP VIINYET COPIED FROM TNER YOU ARE THE TWO PRINCIPLES BROUGHT OUT PERFECTLY
1188-133604-0011 THEY ARE BEYOND ALL OTHER WORKS THAN I KNOW EXISTING THEPENDANT FOR THEIR EFFECT ON LOW SUBDUED TOUNNS THEIR FAVOURIT TOOICE  TIME OF DAY BEYING EITHER DAN OR TWILIGHT AND EVEN THEIR BRIGHT TO SUNSETS PRODUCED CHIEFLY OUT OF GRA PAAPER
1188-133604-0012 IT MAY BE THAT A GREAT COLOURLESS WILL USES UTMOST FORCE OF COLOR AS A SINGER HIS  FULL POWER OF VOICE BUT LOUD OR LOW THE VIRTUES AND BOTH CASES ALWAYS IN MAFINEMENT NEVER IN LOUNNESS
1188-133604-0013 IT MUST REMEMBER BE ONE OR THE OTHER
1188-133604-0014 DO NOT THEREFORE THINK THAT THE GOTHIC SCHOOL' AN EASY ONE
1188-133604-0015 THE LO OF THAT SCHOOLES THAT EVERYTHING SHALL BE SEEN CLEARLY WHERE LEAST ONLY IN SUCH MISTER FAINTNESS AS SHALL BE DELIGHTFUL AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE BEST INRODUCTION TO IT WOULD BE THE ELEMENTARY PRACTICE OF PAINTING EVERY STUDY ON A GOLDEN MOUND
1188-133604-0016 THIS AT ONCE COMPEELLLS YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE WORK IS TO BE IMAGINATIVE IN DECORATIVE THAT IT REPSENTS BEAUTIFUL THINGS IN THE CLEARSTED WAY BUT NOT UNDER EXIST CONDITIONS AND THAT IN FACT YOUR PRODUCING JEERS WORK RATHER THAN PICTURES
1188-133604-0017 THAT A STYLEES WERESTRAINED SEVEREEDES NOT MEAN THAT IT IS ASO REUNNEUS
1188-133604-0018 IN ALL EAR LE GOUTHIC AARTENDEEDUAL FIND FAILURE OF THIS KIND ESPECIAL DISTORTION INRGIDITY WHICH ARE IN MANY RESPECT EX PAINTFULLY TO BE COMPARED WITH THE SPLENDID PROPOSE OF CLASSIC AT
1188-133604-0019 THE LARGE LETTER CONTAINS INDEED ENTIRELY FEEBLE ILL DRAWN FIGURES THAT IS MERELY CHILDERS AND FAILING WORK OF AN INFEAR HAND IT IS NOT CHARACTERISTIC OF GOTHFIC OR ANY OTHER SCHOOL
1188-133604-0020 BUT OBSERVE YOU CANLY DO THIS ON ONE CONDITION THAT OF STRIVING ASOA TO CREATE IN REALITY THE BEAUTY WHICH YOU SEEK IN IMAGINATION
1188-133604-0021 IT WILL BEHOLLL IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO RETAIN THE TRANQULLITY OF TEMPER FELICITY OF FAITH NECESSARY FOR NOBLE PUREERST PAINTING UNLESS YOU ARE ACTIVELY E GAZD PROMOTING THE FLYICITYY AND PEACE OF PRACTICAL LIFE
1188-133604-0022 YOU MUST LOOK AT HIM IN THE FACE FIGHT HIM COQKER HIM WITH WHAT SCAVE YOU MAY YOU NEED NOT THINK TO KEEP OUT IN THE WAY OF HIM
1188-133604-0023 THE COLOORST SAYS FIRST OF ALL AS MY DELICIOUS PARCHA WAS RUBY SO THIS NASTY VIPP SHALL BE BLACK AND THEN IS THE QUESTION CAN I ROUND HIM OFF EVEN THOUGH HE IS BLACK AND MAKE HIM SLIMY AND YET SPRINGY AND CLOS DOWN CLOTDED LIKE A POUOL OFED BLACK BLOOD ON THE EARTH ALL THE SAM
1188-133604-0024 NOTHING WILL BE MORE PRECIOUS TO YOU I THINK IN THE PRACTICAL STUALY OF ART THAN THE CONVICTION WHICH WILL FORC ITSELF ON ANYW MORE MORE EVERY HOUR OF THE WAY ALL THINGS ARE BOUND TOGETHER LITTLE AND GREAT AND SPIRIT AND IN MATTER
1188-133604-0025 YOU KNOW HAVE JUST BEEN TELLING YOU HOW THE SCHOOL MATERIALISM IN CLAY INVOLVED ITSELF AT LAST AND CLOUD AND FIRE

1221-135766-0000 HOW STRANGE IT SEEMED TO THE SAD WOMAN AS SHE WATCHED THE GROWTH AND THE BEAUTY THAT BECAME EVERY DAYAM MORE BRILLIANT AND THE INTELLIGENCE THAT THROUGH ITS S QUIVERING SUNSHINE OVER THE TINY FEATURES OF THIS CHILD
1221-135766-0001 GOD AS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE SIN WHICH MAN THUS PUNISHED HAD GIVEN HER A LOVELY CHILD WHOSE PLACE WAS ON THAT SAME DISHONORED BOSOM TO CONNECT HER PARENT FOREVER WITH THE RACE AND DESCENT OF MORTALS AND TO BE FINDALLY A BLESS SOUL AND HEAVEN
1221-135766-0002 YET THESE THOUGHTS AFFECTED HESTER PRIN LESS WITH HOPE THAN APPREHENSION
1221-135766-0003 THE CHILD HAD A NATIVE GRACE WHICH DOES NOT EVARIABLY CO EXIST WITH FAULTLESS BEAUTY IT'S A TIRE HOWEVER SIMPLE ALWAYS IMPRESSED THE BEHOLDER AS IF IT WERE A VERY GARB THAT PRECISELY BECAME IT BEST
1221-135766-0004 THIS OUTWARD MUUTABILITY INDICATED AND DID NOT MORE THAN FAIRLY EXPRESS THE VARIOUS PROPERTIES OF HER INTER LIFE
1221-135766-0005 S HER COULD ONLY ACOUNT FOR THE CHILD'S CHARACTER AND EVEN THEN MOST VAGILY AND IMPERFECTLY BY RECALLING WHAT SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN DURING THAT MOMENTUSPERIOD WHILE PEARL WAS EMBIBING HER SOUL FROM THE SPIRITUAL WORLD AND HER BODILY FRAING FROM ITSIM MATERIAL OF EARTH
1221-135766-0006 THEY WERE NOW ILLUMINATED BY THE MORNING RADIANCE OF A YOUNG CHILD'S DISPOSITION BUT LATER IN THE DAY OF EARTHLY EXISTENCE MIGHT BE PROLIFIC OF THE STORM AND WHIR AWIND
1221-135766-0007 HESTER PRIN NEVERTHELESS THE LOVING MOTHER OF THIS ONE CHILD RAN LITTLE SK OF AIRRING ON THE SIDE OF UNDUEVERITY
1221-135766-0008 MINDFUL HOWEVER OF HER OWN ERRORS AND MISFORTUNES SHE EARLY SAOUGHW TO IMPOSE A TENDER BUT STRICT CONTROL OVER THE INFIN IMMORTALITY THAT WAS COMMITTED TO HER CHARGE
1221-135766-0009 AS TO ANY OTHER KIND OF DISCIPLINE WHETHER ADDRESSED TO HER MIND OR HEART LITTLE PEARL MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE WITHIN ITS REACH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APRICE THAT ROLLED THE MOMENT
1221-135766-0010 IT WAS A LOOK SO INTELLIGENT ET ITXPLICABLE PERVERSE SOMETIMES SO MALIICIOUS BUT GENERALLY ACCOMPANING BY A WILD FLOW OF SPIRITS THATSTER COULD NOT UP QUESTIONING AT SUCH MOMENTHETHER PEARL WAS A HUMAN CHILD
1221-135766-0011 BEHOLDING ITSTHER WAS CONSTRAINED TO RUSH TOWARDS THE CHILD TO PURSUE THE LITTLE ALTH IN THE FLIGHT WHICH SHE ANDVARIABLY BEGAN TO SNAT HER TO HER BOSOM WITH A CLOSE PRESSURE AND EARNEST CAISES NOT SO MUCH FROM OVERFLOWING LOVE AS TO ASSORE HERSELF THAT PEARL WAS FLULESSHION BLOOD AND NOT UTTERLY DE LOOSIVE
1221-135766-0012 BROODING OVER ALL THESE MATTERS THE MOTHER FELT LIKE ONEAN WHOS VOKE TOPIRIT BUT BY SOME AREGULARITY IN THE PROCESS OF CONJURATION HAS FAILED TO WIND THE MASTER WORD THATUS SHOULD CONTROL THIS NEW AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE INTELLIGENCE
1221-135766-0013 PEARL WAS ABORNE OUTCAST OF THE INFALILE WORLD
1221-135766-0014 QUARL SAW AND GAZED ANDTENTLY BUT NEVER SOUGHT TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE
1221-135766-0015 IF SPOKEN TO SHE WOULD NOT SPEAK AGAIN
1221-135767-0000 HESTER PRIIN WENT ONE DAY TO THE MANSION OF GOVERNOR BELLINGAM WITH A PAIR OF GLOVES WHICH SHE HAD FURGED AND DE EMBORDER TO HIS ORDER AND WHICH WERE TO BE WORN ON SOME GREAT OCCASION OF STATE BORE THOUGH THE CHANCES OF A POPULARLECTION HAD CAUSED THE FORORMER RULER TO DESCEND STEPP OR TWO FROM THE HIGHEST STREAN HE STILL HAL AND HONORABLEULL ANDFLUENTUAL PLACE AMONG THE COLOONIAL MAGEISTRRACY
1221-135767-0001 ANOTHER AND FAR MORE IMPORTANT TH REASON THAN THE DELIVERY OF AP PAIR OF AMBOORED GLOVES IMPELLEDESTER AT THIS TIME TO SEEK AN INTERBIEW WITH A PERSONAGE OF SO MUCH POWER AND DECTIVITY IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE SUETTLEMENT
1221-135767-0002 AT THAT EPOCH OF PRESTENE SIMPLICITY HOWEVER MATTERS OF EVEN SLIGHTER PUBLIC INTEREST AND FAR LESS IN TRINSIC WEIT THAT THE WELLELFIR OFSSTER EN HER CHILD WERE STRANGELY MIXED UP WITH THE DELIBERATIONS OF LEGISLAATORS AND AC OF STATE
1221-135767-0003 THE PERIOD WAS HARDLY IF AT ALL EARLIER THAN THAT OF OUR STORY WHEN A DISPUTE CONCERNING THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY IN APIG NOT ONLY CAUS APIERCE AND BITTER CONTEST IN THE LEGISLAATE OF BODY OF THECLONY BUT RESULTED IN AN IMPORTANT MODIFICATION OF THE FRAMEWORK ITSELF OF THE LEGISLATURE
1221-135767-0004 WE HAVE SPOKEN OF PEARLS RICH ANDLUXUORIANT BEAUTY A BEAUTY THAT SHONE WITH DEEP AND VIVID TINTHS A BRIGHT COMPLEXION EYES POSSESSING INTENSITY BOTH OF DEPTH AND GLOW AND HAIR ALREADY OF A DEEP GLOSY BROWN AND WHICH AND AFTER YEARS WOULD BE NEARLYKIN TO BLACK
1221-135767-0005 IT WAS THE SCARLET LETTER AND ANOTHER FORM THE SCARLET LETTER ENDWOWED WITH LIFE
1221-135767-0006 THE MOTHER HERSELF AS IF THE RED IGNOMINY WERE SO DEEPLY SCORTION TO HER BRAIN THAT ALL HER CONCEPTIONS ASSUMED ITS FORM HAD CAREFULLY WROUGHWT OUT THE SIMILTUDE LAVISHING MANY HOURS OF MORBID ININGENUITY TO CREATE AND ENALGY BETWEEN THE OBJECT OF HER AFFECTION AND THE EMBLEUM OF HER GUT AND TORTURED
1221-135767-0007 BUT IN TRUTH PEARL WAS THE ONE AS WELLOW AS THE OTHER AND ONLY AND CONSEQUINENCE OF THAT IDENTITY HAD HEZTHER CONTRIVE SO PERFECTLY TO REPRESENT THE SCAR AT LETTER IN HER APPEARANCE
1221-135767-0008 COME THEREFORE AND LET US FLING MU AT THEM
1221-135767-0009 BUT PEARL WHO WAS A DAUNTLESS CHILD AFTER FROWNING STAMPING HER FOOT AND SHAKING HER LITTLE HAND WITH AEVERETY OF THREATENING GESTURES SUDDENLY MADE A RUSH AT THEN OF HER ENEMIES AND PUTED THEM ALL TO FLIGHT
1221-135767-0010 SHE SCREAMED AND SHOUTED TWO WITH A TERRIFIC VOLUMUS SOUND WHICH DOUBTLESS CAUSE THE HEARTS OF THE FUGIDS TO QUAKE WITHIN THEM
1221-135767-0011 IT WAS FURTHER DECORATED WITH STRANGE AND SEEMINGLY CABALISTICCK FIGURES AND DIAGRAMS SUITABLE TO THE QUAINT TASTE OF THE AGE WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN IN THE STUCKO WHEN NEWLY LAY ON AND HAD NOW GROWN HARD AND DORABLE FOR THE ADMIRATION OF AFTER TIMES
1221-135767-0012 THEY APPROACHED THE DOOR WHICH WAS OF AN ARCHED FORM AND FLANKED ON EACH SIDE BY A NARROW TOWER OR PROJECTTION OF THE TIFIC IN BOTH OF WHICH WERE LATST WINDOWS THE WOODENS SHUDTERS TO CLOSED OVER THEM AT NEED
1221-135767-0013 LIFTING THE IRON HAMMER THAT HUNG AT THE PORAL HESTER PRIN GAVE A SUMMONS WHICH WAS ANSWERED BY ONE OF THE GOVNOR'S BONDSERVANTS A FREE BORN ENGLISH ME BUT NOW A SEVEN YEAR SLAVE
1221-135767-0014 YET HA HIS HONORABLE WORSHIP HIS WITHIN BUT HE HA A GODLY MINISTER OR TO WITH HIM AND LIKEWISE AT ALLACH
1221-135767-0015 YOU MAY NOT SEE HIS WORSHIP NOW
1221-135767-0016 WITH MANY VARIATIONS SUGGESTED BY THE NATURE OF HIS BUILDING MATERIALS DIVERSITY OF CLIMATE AND A DIFFERENT MODE OF SOCIAL LIFE GOVERNOR BEELLINGAM HAD PLANNED HIS NEW HABITATION AFTER THE RESIDENCES OF GENTLEMEN OF FAIRRISTATE IN HIS NATIVE LAND
1221-135767-0017 ON THE TABLE AND TOKEN THAT THE SENTIMENT OF OLD ENGLISH HOSPITALITY HAD NOT BEEN LEFT BEHIND STOOD A LARGE PUTTER TANQKERD AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH HAD HESTER OR PEARL PEEPED INTO IT THEY MIGHT HAVE SEEN THE FRO THE RENANT OF A RECENT DRAFHT OF ALE
1221-135767-0018 LITTLE PEARL WHO WAS AS GREATLY PLEASED WITH THE GLEAMING ARMOOR AS SHE HAD BEEN WITH THE GLITTERING FRONTE A PIECE OF THE HOUSE SPENT SOME TIME LOOKING INTO THE POLISHED MIROR OF THE BREAST PLATE
1221-135767-0019 MOTHER CRIED SHE I SEE YOU HERE LOOK LOOK
1221-135767-0020 AND TRUTH SHE SEEMED ABSOLUATELY HIDDEN BEHIND IT
1221-135767-0021 PEARL ACCORDINGLY REN TO THE BEOW WINDOW AT THE FURTHER END OF THE HALL AND LOOKED ALONG THE VIST OF A GUARDEN WALK COPETED WITH CLOSELY SHAVEEN GRASS AND BOORDERED WITH SOME RODE AND IMATOR ATTEMPT AT TRUOBERY
1221-135767-0022 BUT THE PROPRIETOR APPEARED ALREADY TO HAVE RE LINGUISHED AS HOPELESS THE AFPRORT TO PPETUATE ON THIS SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC IN A HARD SOIL AND AMID THE CLOSE STRUGGLE FOR SUBSISTENCE THE NATIVE ENGLISH TASTE FOR ORNAMENTAL GARDENING
1221-135767-0023 THERE WERE A FEW ROSEBUSHES HOWEVER AND REMUMBER OF APP TREES PROBABLY THE DESCENDENCE OF THOSE PLINANTTED BY THE REVEREND MISTER BLACK STONE THE FIRST SETTL OF THE PINSLA THAT HALF METHOLOGICAL PERSON TO RIDES THROUGH ARE EARLY ANNIMALS SEATED ON THE BACK OF A BL
1221-135767-0024 PEARL SEEING THE ROSEB BUSHES BEGAN TO CRF FOR OUR REDROWS AND WOULD NOT BE PASSIFIED
1284-1180-0000 HE WORE BLUE SILK STOCKINGS BLOY PS WITH GOLD BUCKLES A BLUE RUOUGHFLED WAIST AND A JACKET OF BRIGHT BLUE BRIGHTED WITH GOLD

1284-1180-0003 FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD WISHED TO EXPLOR THE BEAUTIFUL LAND OF AWAS IN WHICH THEY LIVED
1284-1180-0004 WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE UNC SIMPLY LATCHED THE DOOR AND STARTED UP THE PATH
1284-1180-0005 NO ONE WOULD DISTURBED THEIR LITTLE HOUSE EVEN IF ANY ONE CAME SO FAR INTO THE THICK FOREST WHILE THEY WERE GONE
1284-1180-0006 AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN SEPARATED THE COUNTRY OF THE MONKINS FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE GILICANS THE PATH DE DIVIDED
1284-1180-0007 HE KNEW IT WOULD TAKE THEM TO THE HOUSE OF THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN BUT WHO WAS THEIR NEAREST NEIGHBORUR
1284-1180-0008 ALL THE MORNING THEY TRUDGED UP THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND AT NOON UNC AND O JO SAT ON A FALLEN TREE TRUNK AND AT THE LAST OF THE BREAD WHICH THE OLD MONCHKIN HAD PLACED IN HIS POCKET
1284-1180-0009 THEN THEY STARTED ON AGAIN AND TWO HOURS LATER CAME IN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE OF DOCTOR PIPED
1284-1180-0010 CANNO TO THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE AND A CHUBBY PLEASANT FAC WOMAN DRESSED ALL AND BLUE OPENED IT AND GREETED THE VISITORS WITH A SMILE

1284-1180-0029 SOMETIMES IT IS CALLED A CRAZY QUIILT BECAUSE THE PATES AND COLOORURS ARE SO MIXED UP
1284-1180-0030 WHEN I FOUND DID IT I SAID TO MYSELF THAT IT WOULD DO NICELY FOR MY SERVANT GIRL FOR WHEN SHE WAS BROUGHT TO LIFE SHE WOULD NOT BE PROUD NOR HAUGHTY AS THE GLASS CAT IS FOR SU TO DREADFUL MIXTURE OF COLOORS WOULD DISCOUR HER FROM TIME TO BE AS DIGNIFIED AS THE BLUE MUNCHKINS ARE

1284-1181-0002 THE HEAD OF THE PATCHW GIRL WAS THE MOST CURIOUS PART OF HER
1284-1181-0003 THE HAIR WAS OF BROWN YARN AND HUNG DOWN ON HER NECKON SEVERAL NEAT BRAIDS
1284-1181-0004 GOLD IS THE MOST COMMON MEADAL IN THE LAND OF AWES AND IS USED FOR MANY PURPOSES BECAUSE IT SOFT IN IMPLIABLE
1284-1181-0005 NO I FORGT OF ON ABOUT THE BRAINS EXCLAIMED THE WOMAN
1284-1181-0006 WELL THAT MAY BE TRUE AGREED MARGLOT BUT ON THE CONTRARY A SERVANT WITH TOO MUCH BRAINS ISSRE TO BECOME INDEPENDANTENT AND HIGH AND MIGHTY AND FEEL ABOVE HER WORK
1284-1181-0007 SHE POURED INTO THE DISO QUANTITY FROM EACH OF THESE BOTTLES
1284-1181-0008 I THINK THAT WILL DO SHE CONTINUEDE FOR THE OTHER QUALITIESE ARE NOT NEEDED IN A SERVANT
1284-1181-0009 SHE RAN TO HER HUSBANDSIDE AT ONCE AND HELPED HIM LIF THE FOE CAETTLES FROM THE FIRE
1284-1181-0010 THEIR CONTENTS HAD A BOILED AWAY LEAVING IN THE BON OF EACH CAETTLE A FEW GRAINS OF FINE WHITE POWDER
1284-1181-0011 VERY CAREFULLY THE MAGICIAN REMOVE THIS POWDER PLACING IT ALTOGETHER IN A GOLD IN DISH WHERE HE MIXED IT WITH A GOLDEN SPOON
1284-1181-0012 NO ONE SAW HIM DO THIS FOR ALL WERE LOOKING AT THE POWDER OF LIFE BUT SOON THE WOMAN REMEMBERED WHAT SHE HAD BEEN DOING AND CAME BACK TO THE CUPBOARD
1284-1181-0013 OO BECAME A BIT UNEASY AT THIS FOR HE HAD ALREADY PUT QUITE A LOT OF THE CLEVERNESS POWDER IN THE DISH BUT HE DARED NOT INTERFERE IN SO HE COMFORTED HIMSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT ONE CANNOT HAVE TOO MUCH CLEVERNESS
1284-1181-0014 HE SELECTED A SMALL GO BOTTLE WITH A PEPER BOX TOP SO THAT THE POWDER MIGHT BE SPRINKLED ON ANY OBJECT THROUGH THE SMALL HOLES
1284-1181-0015 MOST PEOPLE TAUGHT TOO MUCH SO IT IS A RELIEF TO FIND ONE WHO TALKS TWO LITTLE
1284-1181-0016 I AM NOT ALLOWED TO BEFOREEROR MAGIC EXCEPT FOR MY OWN AMUSEMENT HE TOLD HIS VISITORS AS HE LIGHTED A PIPE WITH A CROOKEN STEAMM AND BEGAN TO SMOKE
1284-1181-0017 THE WISIT OFZ WHO USED TO BE A HUMBUG AND NEW NO MAATIC AT ALL HAS BEEN TAKING LESSONS OF GLNDA AND IUM TOLD EIES GETTING TO BE A PRETTY GOOD WIZZARD BUT HESE NERELY THE ASSISTANT TO THE GREAT SOURCORERS
1284-1181-0018 IT TRULY IS ASSERTED THE MAGICIAN

1284-1181-0021 ASKED THE VOICE IN SCORN F ACCENTS
1284-134647-0000 THE GREATEFUL APPLAWUS OF THE CLERGY HAS CONSEQUTED THE MEMORY OF A PRINCE WHO INDULGE THEIR PASSIONS AND PROMOTED THEIR INTEREST
1284-134647-0001 THE EEDICT OF MI L THE GREAT CHARDERTER OF TOLATION HAD CONFIRMED TO EACH INDIVIDUAL OF THE ROMAN WORLD THE PRIVILEGE OF CHOSING AND PROFESSING HIS OWN RELIGION
1284-134647-0002 BUT THIS INNEESTIMABLE PRIVILEGE WAS SOON VIOLATED WITH A KNOWLEDGE OF TRUTH THE EMPEROR ANDBB THE MAXS OF PERSECUTION AND THE SECTX WHICH DESSENTED FROM THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WERE AFFLICTED AND OPRESSED BY THE TRIUMPH OF CHYSTIANITY
1284-134647-0003 CONSTANT EASILY BELIEVED THAT THE HATICS WHO PRESUMED TO DISPUTE HIS OPINIONS ORS OPPOSE HIS COMMANDS WERE GUILTY OF THE MOST ABSURD AND CRIMINAL OBSTINACY AND THAT A SEASONABLE AFPLICATION OF MODERS SEVERITIES MIGHT SAVE THOSE UNHAPPY MEN FROM THE DANGER OF AN EVERLAST IN CONDEINNATION
1284-134647-0004 SOME OF THE PEN REGULATIONS WERE COPIED FROM THE EEDICS OF DI CLEATION AND THIS METHOD OF CONVERSION WAS APPLODED BY THE SAME BISHOPS WHO HAD FELLLT THE HAND OF OPPRESSION AND PLEADED FOR THE RIGHTS OF HUMANITY
1284-134647-0005 THE ASSERTED WITH CONFIDENCE AND ALMOST WITH EXULTATION THAT THE APPOICAL SUCCESSION WAS INTERRUPCTTED THAT ALL THE BISHIOPS OF EOROPE AND AASIA WERE INFECTED BY THE CONTASION OF GUILT IN SCISM AND THAT THE POGATIVE OF THE CAFFIC CHURCH WERE CONFINED TO THE CHOSEN IMPORTION OF THE AFRICEN BELIEVERS WHO ALONE HAD PRESERVED IN VIOLETT THE INTAGRITY OF THEIR FAITH AND DISIPLIIN
1284-134647-0006 BISHOPS VIRGIONS AND EVEN SPOTLESS INFANTENCE WERE SUBJECTED TO THE DISGRACE OF A PUBLIC PENANTS BEFORE THEY COULD BE ADMITTED TO THE CONMUNION OF THE DNATISTS
1284-134647-0007 PRESCRIBED BY THE CIVIL AND ECLESIASTICAL OF POWERS OF THE EMPIRE THE DANTIST STILL MAINTAINED IN SOME PROVINCES PARTICULALARLY INDMEDIA THEIR SUPERIOR NUMBERS AND FOUR HUNDREDBISHHOPSCKNOWLEDGE THE JURICTION OF THEIR PRIMMATE
1320-122612-0000 SINCE THE PERIOD OF OUR TIL THE ACTIVE SPIRIT OF THE COUNTRY A SURROUNDED IT WITH A BELT OF RICH AND THRIVING SETTLEMENTS THOUGH NONE BUT THE HUNTER OR THE SAVAGES EVER KNOWN EVEN NOW TO PENETRART ITS WILD RECESSES
1320-122612-0001 THE DWES WERE SUFFERED TO EX HAIL AND THE SUN HAD DISPERSED THE MISTS AND WAS SHETTING A STRONG AND CLEAR LIGHT IN THE FOREST WHEN THE TRAVELLERS RESUMED THEIR JOURNEY
1320-122612-0002 AFTER PROCEEDING A FEW MILES THE PROGRESS OF HOCK E IY WHO LED THE ADVANCE BECAME MORE DELIBERATE AND WATCHFUL
1320-122612-0003 HE OFTEN STOPPED TO EXAMINED THE TREES NOR DID HE CROSSVUL WITHOUT ATTENTIVELY CONSIDERING THE QUANTITY THE VELOCITY AND THE COLOR OF ITS WAATERS
1320-122612-0004 DISTRUSTING HIS OWN JUDGMENT HIS APPEALS TO THE OPINION OF CHING GUTCHKOOK WERE FREQUENT AND EARNEST
1320-122612-0005 YET HERE WE WITHIN A SHORT RANGE OF THE SKONS AND NOT A SIGN OF A TRAIL HAVE A CROSSED
1320-122612-0006 LET US RETRACE OUR STEPS AND EXAMINE AS WE GO WITH KEEN OR EYES
1320-122612-0007 CHUTCH GOOK HAD CAUGHT THE LOOK AND MOTIONING WITH HIS HAND HE BAD HIM SPEAK
1320-122612-0008 THE EYES OF THE WHOLE PARTY FOLLOWED THE UNEXPECTED MOVEMENT AND READ THEIR SUCCESS IN THE AIR OF TRIUMPH THAT THE YOUTH ASSUMED
1320-122612-0009 ITID WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE WONDERFUL HAD HE SPOKEN WITHOUT A BIDDING
1320-122612-0010 SE SAID UNCAS POINTING NORTH AND SOUTH AT THE EVIDENT MARKS OF THE BROAD TRAIL ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM THE DARK HAIR HAS GONE TOWARD THE FOREST
1320-122612-0011 IF A ROCK OR VUET OR A BIT OF EARTH HARDER THAN COMMON SEVERED THE LENKS OF THE CLO THEY FOLLOWED THE TRUE EE OF THE SCOUT RECOVERED THEM AT A DISTANCE AND SELDOM RENDERED THE DELAY OF A SINGLE MOMENT NECESSARY
1320-122612-0012 EXTINGUISHED BRANS WERE LYING AROUND A SPRING THE AWFULELS OF A DEERAR WERE SCATTERED ABOUT THE PLACE AND THE TREESBRE EVIDENT MARKS OF HAVING BEEN BROWSED BY THE HORSES
1320-122612-0013 A CIRCLE OF A FEW HUNDRED FEED IN CIRCUM FRENCE WAS DRAWN AND EACH OF THE PARTY TOOK A SEGMENT FOR HIS PORTION
1320-122612-0014 THE EXAMINATION HOWEVER RESULTED IN NO DISCOVERY
1320-122612-0015 THE WHOLE PARTY CROWDED TO THE SPOT WERE UNCST POINTED OUT THE IMPRESSION OF A MOOCASON IN THE MOIST DELLVION
1320-122612-0016 RUN BACK UNCASS AND BRING ME THE SIZ OF THE SIGORS FOOT
1320-122617-0000 NOTWITHSTANDING THE HIGH RESOLUTION OF HOWK EY HE FULLY COMPREHENDED ALL THE DIFFICULTIES AND DANGER HE WAS ABOUT TO ENCUR
1320-122617-0001 IN HIS RETURN TO THE CAMP HIS ACCUTE HIM PRACTISED INTELLECTX WERE INTENTLY ENGAGED IN DEDVISING MEANS TO COUNTERACT A WATCHFULNESS AND SUSPICION ON THE PART OF HIS ENEMIES THAT HE KNEW WERE IN NO DEGREE INFERIOR TO HIS OWN
1320-122617-0002 IN OTHER WORDS WHILE HE HAD E IMPLICIT FAITH IN THE ABILITY OF BAILM'S ASKED TO SPEAK HE WAS SOWHAT SKEPTAIC ON THE SUBJECT OF A BAAR SINGING AND YET HE HAD BEEN ASURED OF THE LATTER ON THE TESTIMONY OF HIS OWN EXQUISIT ORGANS
1320-122617-0003 THERE WERE SOMETHING IN HIS AIR AND THE MANNER THAT BETRAYED TO THE SCOUT THE UTTER CONFUSION OF THE STATE OF HIS MIND
1320-122617-0004 THE INGENIIOUS HAWK I WHO RECALLED THE HASTY MANNER IN WHICH THE OTHER HAD ABANDON HIS POST AT THE BED S OF THE SICK WOMAN WAS NOT WITHOUT HIS SUSPICIONS CONCERNING THE SUBJECT OF SO MUCH SOLEMN DELIBERATION
1320-122617-0005 THE BARE SHOOK HIS SHAGGY SIDES AND THEN A WELL KNOWN VOICE REPLIED

1320-122617-0010 THE TASK WILL NOT BE DIFFICULT RETURN DAVID HESITATING THOUGH I GREATLY FE YOUR PRESENCE WOULD RATHER INCREASE THE MIIGATE HIS UNHAPPY FORTUNES
1320-122617-0011 THE LOGE IN WHICH UN OWNCAS WAS CONFINED WAS IN THE VERY CENTRE OF THE VILLAGE AND IN A SITUATION PERHAPS MORE DIFFICULT THAN ANY OTHER TOPPROACH OR LEAVE WITHOUT OBSERVATION
1320-122617-0012 FOR OR FIVE OF THE LATTER ONLY LINGERED ABOUT THE DOOR OF THE PRISON OF UNCAS WHEREARY BUT CLOSE OBSERVERS OF THE MANNER OF THEIR CAPTIVE
1320-122617-0013 DELIVERED IN A STRONG TONE OF AS CENT ANNOUNCED THE GRATIFICATION THE SAVAGE WOULD RECEIVE IN WITNESSING SUCH AN EXHIBITION OF WEATNESS AND AN ENEMY SO LONG HATED AND SO MUCH FEARD
1320-122617-0014 THEY DREW BACK A LITTLE FROM THE ENTRANCE AND MOTION TO THE SUPPOSEED CONJUR TO ENTER
1320-122617-0015 BUT THE BAAR INSTEAD OF OBEYING MAINTAINED OF THE SEATED HAD TAKEN AND GROWLED
1320-122617-0016 THE CUNNING MAN AS AFRAID THAT HIS BREATH WILL BLOW UPON HIS BROTHERS AND TAKE AWA THEIR COURAGE TOO CONTINUED DAVID IMPROVING THE HAND HE RECEIVED THEY MUST STAND FURTHER OFF
1320-122617-0017 THEN IS IF SATISFIED OF THEIR SAFETY THE SCOUT LEFT HIS POSITION AND SLOWLY ENTERED THE PLACE
1320-122617-0018 IT WAS SILENT AND GLOOMY BEING TENANTID SOLELY BY THE CAPTIVE AND LIGHTED BY THE DYING EMBERS OF A FIRE WHICH HAD BEEN USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF CCKERY
1320-122617-0019 UNNCAS OCCUPIED A DISTANT CORNER IN RECLINING ATTITUDE BEING RIGIDLY BOUND BOTH HANDS AND FEET BY STRONG AND PAIN FOR WITHS
1320-122617-0020 THE SCOUT WHO HAD LEFT DVID AT THE DOOR TO ASCERTAIN THEY WERE NOT OBSERVED THOUGHUN IT PRUDENT TO PRESERVE HIS DISGUISE UNTIL ASSURED OF THEIR PRIVACY
1320-122617-0021 WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH THE MINGERS AT THE DOOR THEY COUNT SIX AND THE SINGERS AS GOOD AS NOTHING

1320-122617-0023 UNCAS WHO HAD ALREADYPPROACHED THE DOOR AND READINESS TO LEAD THE WAY NOW RECOILED AND PLACED HIMSELF ONCE MORE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE LODGE
1320-122617-0024 BUT HAK I WHO WAS TOO MUCH OCCUPIED WITH HIS OWN THOUGHTS TO NOTE THE MOVEMENT CONTINUED SPEAKING MORE TO HIMSELF INTO HIS COMPANION
1320-122617-0025 SO UNCUS YOU HAD BETTER TAKE THE LEAD WHIL I WILL PUT ON THE SKIN AGAIN  TRUST TO CUNNING FOR WANT OF SPEED

2094-142345-0007 THE HISTORY OF THE HOUSE IS PLAINED NOW

2300-131720-0000 THE PARIS PLANED LIKE THAT OF THE CRYSTAL PALACE WAS AT TEMPORARY EXHIBIT
2300-131720-0001 THE LONDON PLAT WASLULESS TEMPORARY BUT NOT PERMANED SUPPLYING BEFORE WAS TORN OUT NO FEWER THAN THREE THOUSAND LAMPS IN HOTELS CHURCHES STORES AND DWELLINGS AND THE VISCINITY OF HOLBORN VIU
2300-131720-0002 THERE MASSIS JOHNSON AND HAMER PUT DE PRACTICE MANY OF THE IDEAS NOW STANDARED IN THE ART AND SECURED MUCH USEFUL DATEA OF FOR THE WORK IN NEW YORK OF WHICH THE STORY HAS JUST BEEN TOLD
2300-131720-0003 THE DINAMIM ELECTRIC MACHINE THO SMALL WAS ROBST FORO UNDER ALL THE VERY IN SPEEDS OF WATER POWER AND THE VISISTITUDES OF THE PLANT TO WHICH IT THELONGED IT CONTINUED IN ACTIVE USE UNTIL EIGHTEEN NINIGHTY NINE SEVENTEEN YEARS
2300-131720-0004 OWING TO HIS INSISTSNG LOW PRESSURE DIRECT CURRENT FOR USE IN DENTSLY POPULATED DISTRICTS AS THE ONLY SAFE AND TRULY UNIVERSAL PROFITABLE WAY OF DELIVERING ELECTRICAL ENERGY TO THE CONSUMERS ADDISON HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY SPOKEN OF AN AS AN OPPONENT OF THE ALTERNATINGCURRENT
2300-131720-0005 WHY IF WE ERECTSTATION AT THE FALLS IT IS A GREAT ACOMMY TO GET IT UP TO THE CITY
2300-131720-0006 THERE SEEMS NO GOOD REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT IT WILL CHANGE
2300-131720-0007 BRAD AS THE PRARIIS AND FREE IN THOUGHT AS WINDS THAT SWEPT THEM HE IS IEDIOS ANDCTICALLY OPPOSEED TO LOOSEEN WASISTEFUL MOTHFITS TO PLANS OF ENPIRE THAT NEGLECT THE POOR THE GATE
2300-131720-0008 AT EVERYTHING HE HAS DAWN HAS BEEN AIMED THAT THE CONSERPATION OF ENERGY THE CONTRACTION OF SPACE THE INTENSIFLICATION OF CULTURE
2300-131720-0009 FOR YEARS IT WAS NOT FOUN PEASIBLE TO OPERATE MOTORS ON ALTERNATING CURRENT CIRCUITS AND THAT REASON WAS OFTEN URGED AGAINST IT SERIOUSLY
2300-131720-0010 IT COULD NOT BE USED FOR ELECTR PLATING OR DEPOSITION NOR COULD A CHARGEG STGE BATTERIES ALL OF WHICH ARE EASILY WITHIN THEABILITY OF THE DERECT
2300-131720-0011 BUT WHEN IT CAME TO BE A QUESTIONAT OF LIGHTING A SCATTERED SUBBURB A GROUP OF DWELLINGS ON THE OUTSKIRTS A REMOTE COUNTRY RESIDTENCE OR A FAR MOUS THE ALTERNATING CURR IN ALL ELEMENTS SAV IT'S DANGER WAS ANDDEAS IDEAL
2300-131720-0012 ATDISON WAS IN INTOLEANT OF SHAM AND SHUDY AND NOTHING WOULD SATISFY HIM THAT COULD NOT STAND CROSS EXAMINATION BY MY CH SCOPE TEST TWOUB AND GAVONOMETER
2300-131720-0013 UNLESS HE COULD SECURE AN ENGINE OF SMOTH THE RUNNING AND MORE EXACTLY GOVERN AND REGULATED THE THOSEVEABLE FOR HIS DNAMIM AND LAMP ADDISON REALIZEDE THAT HE WOULD FIND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE A STDY LIGHT
2300-131720-0014 MISTER ATDIZIN WAS A LEADER FORAR A HADAD OF THE TIME
2300-131720-0015 HE OBTAINED THE DESIRED SPEED AND LOAD WITH A FRICTIONM BREAK ALSO REGULATOR OF SPEED LOOK WAITED FOR AN INDICATARED A AIRRIFIED
2300-131720-0016 THEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO KNOWN WAY TOLUBERRICAT AN ENGEIME FOR CONTINUUS RUNNING AND MISTER ATICON INFORM THATSM MAENE ENGIN STARTED BEFORE THE SHIP LEFT THE YORK ON CONTINUED RUNNING UNTIL IT REACHED ITSM PORT SO AN ENGINEED FOR HIS PURPOSES MUS PRODUCED LIGHT AT ALL TIMES
2300-131720-0017 ADISENT HAD INSTALLED HIS HIS STARIC FIRST GREAT CENTRAL STATION SYSTEMANY YORK ON THE MULTABLE AR SYSTEM COVERED BY HIS FEEDER AND MA INVENTION WHICH RESULTED IN UNNOABLE SAVING IN THE COST OF CONDUCTORS AS AGAINST TO STRAIGHT TWO WIRE SYSTEM THROUGH OUT OF THE TREEIND
2300-131720-0018 HE SOON FOR SAW THAT STILL GREATER A CONOMMY WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR COMMERCIAL SUCCESS NOT ALONE FOR THE LARGER TERRITORY OPENING BUT FOR THE COMPACT DISTRICT OF LARGE CITIES
2300-131720-0019 THE STRONG POSITION HELD BY THE ATIS AND SYSTEM UNDER THE STREATEUOUS COMPETICITION THAT WAS ALREADY SPRINGING UP WAS ENORMOUSLY IMPROV BY THE INTRODUCTION OF THE THREE WIRE SYSTEM AND IT GAVE AN IMMEDIATE EMPERIDUS TO INCANDESCENT LIGHTING
2300-131720-0020 IT WAS SPECIALLY SUITED FOR A TRIAL PLAT ASO IN THE EARLY DAYS WHEN A YIELD OF SIX OR OR EIGHT LAMPS TO THE HORSEPOWER WAS CONSIDER SUBJECT FOR CONGRATULATION
2300-131720-0021 THE STREET CONDUCTORS WERE OF THE OVERHEAD PULE LINE CONSTRUCTION AT WERE INSTALLED BY THE CONSTRUCTION COMPENYY THAT HAD BEEN ORGANIZED BYDISENT TO BUILD EQUPTS CENTRAL STATIONS
2300-131720-0022 MEANWHILE HE HAD CALLED UPON ME TO MAKE A REPORT OF THE THREE W SYSTEM KNOWN IN ENGLAND AS THE HOPKINSON BOTH DOCTOR JOHN HOPKINSON AND MISTER EDISON BEING INDEPENDENT IN VENERS AT PRACTICALLY THE SAME TIME
2300-131720-0023 I THINK HE WAS PERHAPS MORE APPRECI DEIVE THAT I WAS OF THE DISCIPLINE OF THE ATDISIN CONSTRUCTION DE TOPTMENT AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR US TO WAIT UNTIL THE MORNING OF THE FURTH BEFORE WE STARTED UP
2300-131720-0024 BUT THE PLANT RAN AND IT WAS THE FIRST THREE WIRE STATIONED IN THIS COUNTRY
2300-131720-0025 MAY WERE LATER USED AS RESERBEDBISHCHINS AND FINALLY WITH THE ENGINE RETIRED FROM SERVICE AS PART OF THE COLLECTION OF AT ASSONIA BUT THEY REMAIN IN PRACTICALLY IS GOOD CONDITION AS ONE INSTALLED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHT E THREE
2300-131720-0026 THE ARLAP INSTALLED OUTSIDE A CCUSTOMS PROMISES OR IN A CIRCUIT FOR PUBLIC STREET LIGHTING BURNED SO MANY HOURS NIGHTLY SO MANY NIGHTS IN THE MONTH AND WAS PAID FOR AT THAT R SUBJECT TO REBATE FOR HOURS WHEN THE LAMP LIKE BE OUT THROUGH AXB
2300-131720-0027 EVISON HELD THAT THE ELECTICITY SOLD MUST BE MEASUR JUST LIKE GASS OR WATER AND HE PROCEEDED TO DEVELOP A METER
2300-131720-0028 THERE WAS INFINITE SCEPTICISM AROUND HIM ON THE SUBJECT ANDWHILE OTHER INVENTS WERE ALSO GIVING THE SUBJECT BAFT THE PUBLIC TOOK IT FOR GRATED THAT ANYTHING SO UTTERLY INTANGIBLE AS ELECTRICITY THAT COULD NOT BE SEEN OR WEED AND ONLY GAVE SECOND DARY EVIDENCE OF ITS SELF AT THE EXA POINTED USE COULD NOT BE BROUGHT TO ACUR IT REGISTRATION
2300-131720-0029 HENCE THE ABISTIONON ELECTOR LITIC METEROR IS NO LONGER USED DESPITED ITS EXCELLENT QUALITIES
2300-131720-0030 THE PRINCIPAL EMPLOYED IN THE ATATISON ELECTORLIIC MEEDTERER IS NOT WHICH EXEMPLEFIES THE POWER OF ELECTICITY TO DEC IMPOS A CHEICAL SUBSTANCE
2300-131720-0031 ASSOCIATED WITH THE SIMPLE FORM OF APPARATUS WERE VARIOUS ININGENIOUS DETAS AND REFINEMENTS TO SECURE REGULARITY OF OPERATION FREEDOM FROM INACCURACY AND IMMUNITY FROM SUCH TMPERING AS WOULD PMIT FAFTIVE CURRENT OR DAMAGE
2300-131720-0032 THE STANDARD ATIS MEET PRACTICE WAS TO REMOVE THE CEELVES ONCE AMONTH TO THE METER ROOM OF THE CENTRAL STATION COMPANY FOR EXAMINATION ANOTHER SAT BEING SUBSTITUTED
2300-131720-0033 IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT MISTER DOUBU J JENS RE AN INTERESTING PAPER BEFORE THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ALECTRICNGINEERS ON THE SIX YEARS OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE HAD UP TO THAT TIME WITH THE METER THE MORE GENERALLY IN USED THAN AND THE OTHER
2300-131720-0034 THE OTHERS HAVING BEEN AN OPPERATION TO SHORT AT TIME TO SHOW DEFINITE RESULTS ALTHOUGH THEY ALSO W QUICKLY TO A DIVID EN BASES
2300-131720-0035 IN THIS CONNECTION IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED THAT THE ASSOCIATION OF ADISON ILLUMINATING COMPANIES IN THE SAME YEAR ADOPTED RESOLUTIONSUANAMIMOUSLY TO THE EFFECT THAT THE EDISIT MEOR WAS ACTURATE AND THAT ITS USE WAS NOT EXPENS IT FOR STATIONS ABOVE ONE THOUSAN LIGHTS AND THAT THE BEST FANTIONU RESULTS WERE INVRIIABLY SECUR IN A STATION SELLINGCURT B METERER
2300-131720-0036 THE MEETER CONTINUED IN GENERAL SERVICE DURING EIGHTEEN NINIGHTY NINE AND PROBABLY UP TO THE CLOTHES OF THE CENTURY
2300-131720-0037 HE WIGAIGED AND REWAED THE METERTHER PLATES AND PURSUED EVERY LINE OF INVESTIGATION IMAGINABLE BUT ALL IN VAIN
2300-131720-0038 HE FEL HE WAS UPP AGAINST IT AND THAT PERHAPS ANO OTHER KIND OF A JOB WOULD SUIT HIM BETTER
2300-131720-0039 THE PROBLEM WAS SALT
2300-131720-0040 WE WERE MORE INTERESTED IN THE TEGCHNICAL CONDITION OF THE STATION THAN IN THE COMMERCIAL PARTT
2300-131720-0041 WE HAD NETERS IN WHICH THERE WERE TWOO BOTTLES OF LIQUID

2830-3979-0000 WE WANT YOU TO HELP US PUBLISH SOME LEADING WORK OFLUETHERS FOR THE GENERAL AMERICAN MARKET WILL YOU DO IT
2830-3979-0001 THE CONDITION IS THAT I WILL BE PERMITTED TO MAKE LUU OR TALK AMERICAN STREAMN HIM SO TO SPEAK BECAUSE WILL NEVER GET PEOPLE WHETHER INN OUTSIDE THE LUTH AND CHURCH ACTUALLY TO READ LUTHER AND MUST WE MAYKE TALK AS HE WOULD TALK TO DAY TO AMERICANS
2830-3979-0002 LET US BEGIM WITH THAT HIS COMMONARY UNGLATIONS
2830-3979-0003 THE UNDERTAKING WHICH SEEMED SO ATTRACTIVE WHEN VIEWED AS A LITERARY TASKU PROVED THE MOST DIFFICULT ONE AND AT TIMES BECAME A PRESSIVE
2830-3979-0004 IT WAS WRITT AND LATON
2830-3979-0005 THE WORK HAD TO BE CONVCED
2830-3979-0006 OR ORS NOT BE SET ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF LUE'S COMMONAR UNNGLATIONS
2830-3979-0007 MUCH LATER WHEN A FRIEND OF HIS WAS PREPARING INDDITION OF ALL HIS LATIN WORKS HE REMARKED TO HIS HOME CIRCLE IF I HAD MY WAY ABOUT IT THEY WOULD REPOUBLISH ONLY THOSE OF MY BOOKS WHICH HAVE DOCTRINE MY GLATIONS FOR INSTANCE
2830-3979-0008 IN OTHER WORDS THESE THREAMM TOOK DOWN THE LEXURES WHICH  LIU THEIR ADDRESS TO HISUDS IN THE COURSE OF GLATIONS AND ROAR PREPARED THE MANYCRIP FOR THE PRINTER
2830-3979-0009 IT PRESENTS LIKE NO OTHER OFLUTHER'S RETINGS THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF CHRISTIANITY THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE CINREER FOR THE SAKE OF CHRIST MERITS ALONE
2830-3979-0010 BUT THE ESSENCE OF LUS LECTURES IS THERE
2830-3979-0011 THE LORD WAS GIVENUS POWER TO TEACH AND TO HEAR LET HIM ALSO GIVE US THE POWER TO SERVE AND TO DO LO TO
2830-3979-0012 THE WORD OF OUR GOD SHALL STAND FOREVER
2830-3980-0000 IN EVERY WAY THEY SOUGHT TO UNDERMIND THE AUTHORITY OF SEEM PAUL
2830-3980-0001 THEY SAID TO THE GLATIONS YOU HAVE RIGHT TO THINK EIGHLY OF PA
2830-3980-0002 HE WAS THE LAST TURNED A CHRIST
2830-3980-0003 POKING LATER IN HIS BENEATH THUS
2830-3980-0004 INDEED HE PERSECUTED THE CHURCH OF CHRIST FOR A LONG TIME
2830-3980-0005 DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT GOD FOR THE SAKE OF A FEWLUTHEHERTICS THE SO OWN HIS ENTIRCHURCH
2830-3980-0006 AGAINST THESE BOASTING FALSEPP POOSSELS PUL BODLYE DEFENCE HIS APPOSTOLICUTHORITY E MIINISTRY
2830-3980-0007 AS THE EMBASSADER OF A GOVERNMENT IS HONORED FRE HIS OFFICE AND NOT FIRST PRIVATE PERSON SO THE MINISTER OF CRY SHOULD EXULT HIS OFFICE IN ORDERS GA AUTHITY AMONG MEN
2830-3980-0008 PULTICS PRID HIS MINISTRYY NOT TO HIS OWN PRAISE BUT TO THE PRACE OF GOD
2830-3980-0009 PA AND A POSSEL NOT OF MEN ET CETER
2830-3980-0010 EI OF HE CALLS MINISTERS TO THE EIGHTENCY OF MEN OR CAUSED THEM DIRECTLY AS HE CALLED THE PROPFITS AND A POSTSLES
2830-3980-0011 PAWLLED THE CLAARS OF THE FALSEPPOSSS WERE CALLED THEIR SENT NEITHERED BY MEN NOR BY MAN
2830-3980-0012 THE MOST THEY COULD CLAIM IS THAT THEY WERE SENTP BY OTHERS
2830-3980-0013 HE METIONED THE APOSALS FIRST BECAUSE THEY REPOINTED DIRECTED BY GOD
2830-3980-0014 THE CALL AS NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY
2830-3980-0015 FOR PERSON TO POSSESSED KNOWLEDGE IS MO ENOUGH
2830-3980-0016 IS SPOILS ONE'S BEST WORK
2830-3980-0017 WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN I THOUGHT PUL WAS MAKING TOO MUCH OF HIS CALL
2830-3980-0018 I DID NOT THEN REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MINISTRYY
2830-3980-0019 I MA NOTHING OF THE DOCTRIIM OF FAITH BECAE WERE WERETAUGHT SOREEN ATAD A CERTAINY AND NOBODY UNDERSTOOD SPIRITCHIAL BOASTING
2830-3980-0020 THIS IS NO SIMVAL PRIDE IT IS WHOLLY PRIDE
2830-3980-0021 AND GOD THE FATHER WHO RACED HIM FROM THE DEAD
2830-3980-0022 THE CLOSSM SUPERVOLOUS ON FIRST SIDE
2830-3980-0023 THESE PROVERS OF THE RTCHNESS OF CHRIST RESIST THE FATHER AND THE SUN AND THE WORKS OF THEM BOTH
2830-3980-0024 IN THIS WHOLE PISTOL PULTREATS OF THE RESRECTION OF CHRIST
2830-3980-0025 BY HIS RESURRECTION CHRIIS ONE THE VICTORY OVER LAW SIN FLESH WIRLD DEVIL DEATH HELL AND EVERY EVIL
2830-3980-0026 FIRST TO
2830-3980-0027 AND ALL THE BREATH ROOM WHICH ARE WITH ME
2830-3980-0028 THIS GOG FAR AND SHTTING THE MOTH OF THE FALSE OF POOSSS
2830-3980-0029 ALTHOUGH THE BRTHREN WITH WE ARE NOT A POSSS LIKE MYSELF YET THERE ALL OF ONE MIND WITH ME THINK RIGHT AND TEACHES I DO
2830-3980-0030 THEY DO NOT GO WITH THE ENEMIES OF THE GOSPEL PDOMINY THEY GO WERE THE QUESTIONANS ARE
2830-3980-0031 WHYED THAN EVYED THE CATHIC PROVINCES IMPREACHED THEIR DOCTRINE TO GODLESS PRINCES BISHOPS AND DOCTORS AS WE HAVE THEM BY THE HELP OF GOD
2830-3980-0032 WE LOOKED FOR THAT REWARD WHICH I HAVETH NOT SEE NOR EAR HEARD NEITHER HATH ENTERED INTO THE HEART OF MAN
2830-3980-0033 NOT ALL THEGLATIONS HAD BECOME PREVERTED
2830-3980-0034 THESE MEANS CANNOT BE CONTAMIN
2830-3980-0035 THEY REMAINED DIVINE REGARDLESS OF ME'S OPINION
2830-3980-0036 WHEREVER THE MEANS OF GRACEER FOUND THERE IS THE HOLYY CHURCH EVEN THOUGH INTE CHST REAMS THERE
2830-3980-0037 SO MUCH FOR THE TITLE OF THE APISTOL NOW FOLLOWS THAT READING OF THE APOSSEL VERS THREE
2830-3980-0038 GRACE BE TO YOU AND PEACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND FROM OUR LOR JESUS CHRIST
2830-3980-0039 THE RMS OF GRACE AND PIECE OR COMMON TERMS WITH PALE AND ARE NOW PRETTY WELL UNDERSTOOD
2830-3980-0040 THE BRING OF THE APOSSELS REFRESHION
2830-3980-0041 GRACE ANDVLLS THE REMISSION OF SENDS PEACE AND A HAPPY CONSCIENCE
2830-3980-0042 THE WORLD BRINS THIS SUPPRINITIOUS DOCT ROOM
2830-3980-0043 EXPERIENCE PROVES THIS
2830-3980-0044 HOWEVER THE GRACE AND PIEACE OF GOD WILL
2830-3980-0045 MEN SHOULD NOT SPECULATE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
2830-3980-0046 WAS IT NOT ENOUGH TO SAY FROM GOD THE FATHER
2830-3980-0047 TO DO SO IS TO LOSE GOD ALTOGETHER BECAUSE GOD BECOMES IN INTOLERABLE WHEN WE SEEK TO MEASURURE TO COMPREHEND HISMFINITE MAJESTY
2830-3980-0048 HE CAME DOWN TO EARTH LIVED AMONG MEN SUFFERED WAS CHUCIFIED AND THEN HE DIED STANDING CLEARLY BEFORE US SO THAT OUR HEARTS AND EYES MA FASEN UPON HIM
2830-3980-0049 EMBRACE HIM AND FORGET ABOUT THE NAURE OF GOD
2830-3980-0050 DID NOT CHRIIC HIMSELF SAY I AM THE WAY AND THE TRUTH IN THE LIFE NO MAN COME UN TO THE FATHER BUT BY ME
2830-3980-0051 WHEN YOU ARE YOU ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD APAR FROM THE QUESTION OF JUSTIFICATION YOU MAY BE AS PROFOUND AS YOU LIKE
2830-3980-0052 WE ARE TO HEAR CHRIST TO HAS BEEN APPOINTED BY THE FATHER AS ARE DIVINE TEACHER
2830-3980-0053 AT THE SAME TIME PULK CONFIRMS ARE CREED THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD
2830-3980-0054 THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD IS APPEARENT IN THAT POLESTCRIBES TO HIM DIVINE POWERS EQUALLY WITH THE FATHER AS FORRE INSTANCE THE POWER TO THE SPENSE GRACE AND PEACE
2830-3980-0055 TO BESTOW PEACE AND GRACE LIES IN THE PROVINCE OF GOD WHO A LONG CONCEATE THESE PLESSINGS THE ANNGELS CANNOT
2830-3980-0056 OTHERWISE PAUL SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN GRACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND PEACE FROM OUR A LORD JESUS CHRIST
2830-3980-0057 THE I EIANS TOOK CHRIIS FOR A NOBLE PERFECT CREATURES SUPERIOR EVEN TO THEELS BECAUSE BY HIM GOD CREATED HEAVEN AND EARTH
2830-3980-0058 MOHAMM AT ALSO SPEICALY OF CHRIST
2830-3980-0059 POSTXTEROS THEMEEM
2830-3980-0060 HE NEVER LOSES SIGHT OF THE PURPOS OF HIS APISTIL
2830-3980-0061 NOT GOL OR SILVER OR PASSAL LAMBS OR AN ANGEL BUT HIMSELF WHAT FOR
2830-3980-0062 NOT FOR CROWN WERE KINGDOM OR A GOODNESS BEFORE SINS
2830-3980-0063 UNDERCORE THESE WORDS FOR THEY ARE FULL OF COMFORT FOR SORE CONSCIENCES
2830-3980-0064 HOW MAY WE OBTAINED REMISSION OF OUR OR SINS
2830-3980-0065 POLISWRERS THE MAN WHO WAS NAMED JESUS CHRIST AND THE SUN OF GOD GAVE HIMSELF FOR SINS
2830-3980-0066 SINCE CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS IT STANDS TO REASON THAT THEY COULDNOT BE PUT AWAY BY OUR OWN EFFORTS
2830-3980-0067 THIS SENTS ALSO FINDS OUR SINS AS GREAT SO GREAT IN FACT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD COULD NOT MAKE AMENDS FOR SINGLE SON
2830-3980-0068 THE GREATNESS OF THE RANSOM CHRICE THE SUM OF GOD INDICATS THIS
2830-3980-0069 THE VICIOUS CHARACTER OF S IN IS BROUGHT OUT BY THE WORDS WHO GAVE HIMSELF FOR SINS
2830-3980-0070 BUT WE ARE CARELESS WE MAKE LIGHT OF SIN
2830-3980-0071 WE THINK THAT BY SOME LITTLE WORK REMRIT WE CAN THE SMIS AND
2830-3980-0072 THIS PASSAGE THEN THEREARS OUT THE FACT THAT ALL MANN ARE SOLDLAND D SEN
2830-3980-0073 THIS AT AVITUDES SPRINGS FROM OF FALSE CONCEPTION OF SIN THE CONCEPTIONATE SAN AS A SMALL MATTER EASILY TAKEN CARE OF BY GOOD WORKS THAT WE MUST PRESENT OURSELVESEN TO GOD WITH GOOD CONSCIENCE THAT WE MUST FEEL NO SIN BEFORE MAY FEEL THAT CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SENS
2830-3980-0074 THIS SAVITUDIES UNIVERSAL AND PARTCTUALLY DEVELOPT IN THOSE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES BETTER OF ANOTHERS
2830-3980-0075 BUT THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE IN COMFORT OF THE WORDS FOR OUR SINS IS LOST UPON THEIR
2830-3980-0076 ON THE OTHER HAND WERE NOT TO REGARD THEM AS SO TERRIBLE THAT WEMOST DESPAIR
2961-960-0000 HE PASSES ABRUPTLY FROM PERSONS THE IDEAS AND NUMBERS AND FROM IDEAS AND NUMBERS TO PERSONS FROM THE HEAVENS TO MAN FROM A CHARONOMMY TO PHYSIOLOGY CONFUSES OR RATHER DOES NOT DISTINGUISH SUBJECT AND OBJECT FIRST AND FINAL CAUSES AND IS DREAMING OF JE METRICAL FIGURES LOST IN A FLIS OFS SENS
2961-960-0001 THE INFLUENCE WHICH DO TO ME AS HAS EXSERCISE UPONPOTERITY IS DUEPARLY TO A MISUNDERSTANDING
2961-960-0002 INBAS SUPPOSED DEPTHS OF THIS D THE NEAL PLATINISTS FOLLENUND HIDEN MEANINGS AND CONNEXS WITH THE JEWISH AND CHRISTIAN SCRIPTURES AND OUT OF THEM THEY ELICIT A DOCTRINES QUIPE AT VARIENCE WITH THEPIRRIIT OF PLATO
2961-960-0003 THEY WERE ABSORBED IN HIS THEALITYY AND WERE UNDER THE MANINION OF HIS NAME WHILE THAT WHICH WAS TRULY GREAT IN RULY CORECTURIOUSIC IN HIM IS EFFORT TO REALIZ CONNECT OFBSTRACTIONS WAS NOT UNDERSTOOD BY THEM AT ALL
2961-960-0004 THE IS NO DANGER OF THE MODERREN COMM TTURES TO MEUS FALLING INTO HEBSURNDITIES OF THE O PLATISTS
2961-960-0005 IN THE PRESENT DAY WE ARE WELL A WEE THAT ANTIONIENT PHILOWSPH IS TO BEING CHIRPRETED FROM HIMSELF AND BY THE CONTEMPORARY HIS SHERI OF THOUGHT
2961-960-0006 THE FANCIES OF THE MU PLATISTS ARE ONLY INTERESTING TO US BECAUSE THEY EXHIBIT OFAS OF THE HUMAN MIN WHICH PREVILED WIDELY THE FIRST CENTURIES OF THE CHRISTIAN ERE AND IS NOTLY EXINCT IN OUR OWN DAY
2961-960-0007 BUT THEY HAVE NOTOUGHHING TO DO WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF PLATIL AND INPIRITED THE AREPPOS TO HIM
2961-960-0008 WE DO NOT KNOW HOW PLA TO WOULD HAVE ARRANGED HIS OWN DIS OR WEVER DE THOUGHT OF ARANGING ANY OF BESIDESITTRILLG WHICH HE HAS EXPRESSLY CONNECTED WAS EVER PRESENT TO HIS MIND
2961-960-0009 THE DIAL OF UP IS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITHIMAL CREATION INCLUDING UNDER THIS TM THE HEAVILY BODIES AND WITH MAN BOLY AS ONE AMONG THE ANIMALS
2961-960-0010 BUT HE HAS NOT AS YET THE FIND THIS INTMEDIATE TERY TOORY WHICH WVE SOMEWE BETWEEN MEDICINE AND METHMATICS AND HE WOULD HAVE FELT THAT THERE WAS AS GREAT AN PETY IN WINKING FURIES OF PHYSICS FIRST IN THE ORDER OF KNOWLEDGE AS IN PLACING THE BOTDY BEFORE THE SOUL
2961-960-0011 WITH HERACTUS HE ACKNOWLEDGES THE PERPETUAL FLUS LIKE ANIC SAGARUS HESERVED THE PREDINENCE OF MINNE ALTHOUGH ADMITTING AN ELEMENT OF NECESSITY WHICH REASON IS INCAPABLE OF SUBDU W THE PFGARENS HE SUPPOSES THE MYSTERREY OF THE WORLD TO BE CONTAININGED EN NUMBER
2961-960-0012 MANY IF'S NOT ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THE PISO CREDIC PHILOSAPHY ARE INCLUDED INTO TIMUS
2961-960-0013 IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE RELATION OF THE IDEAS TO GOD OR OF GOD TO THE WORLDST DIFFERENTLY CONCEIVED BY HIM AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF HIS LIFE
2961-960-0014 THE IDEAS ALSO REMAIN BUT THEY HAVE BECOME TYPES IN NATURE FORMS OF MEN ANIMAL SPURGS FICES
2961-960-0015 THE STYILLE AND PLIN OF THE TEES DIFER GREATLY FROM THAT OF ANY OTHER OF THE PLATONIC DIALS

3570-5695-0011 IT IS EVIDENT THERE FU THAT THE PRESENT TREN OF THE DEVELOPMENT IS IN THAT DIRCTION OF HHING THE UTILITY OF CONSPEICCUSE CONCEUPTION AS COMPARED WITH LEISURE
3570-5695-0012 IT IS OSTICIBLE THAT THE SERVIBILTIVE CONSMPTION AS A MEANS OF REPUTE AS WELL AS THE INSISTENCE ON IT AS AN ELEMENT OF DECENCY IS AT ITS SPC IN THOSE PORTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY WHERE HUMAN CONTECT OF THE INDIVIDTUAL'S WIDEST AND THE MOBILITY OF THE PO PPUULATIONS GREATEST

6930-81414-0000 NO WORDS WERE SPOKEN NO LANGUAGE WAS UTTERED SAVE THAT OF WHAILING IN HISSING AND THAT SOMEHOW WAS INDISTINCT AS IF IT EXISTED IN FANCY AND NON IN REALITY
6930-81414-0001 I HEARD AN NOISE BEHIND I TURED AND SO CAFVER HIS BLACK EYES SHINAMING WILE IN HIS HAND HE HELD A GLEAMING KNIFE HE LIFTED ABOVE HIS HEAD AS IF TO STRIKE BUT A HAD THE STRENGTH OF TEN MEN AND I HURLED HIM F FROM ME
6930-81414-0002 ONWOR SAID A DISTANT VOICE
6930-81414-0003 NO SOUND BROKE THE STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT
6930-81414-0004 THE STORY OF IT EVIL INFLUENCE CAME BACK TO ME AND IN MY BEWILDERED CONDITION I WONDERED WHETHER THERE WAS NOT SOME TRUTH AND WHAT HAD BEEN SAID
6930-81414-0005 WHAT WAS THAT
6930-81414-0006 ONE THEN I HUMAN HAND LARGE AND SHAPELY APPEAR DISTINCTLY ON THE SURFACEE UP THE POND
6930-81414-0007 NOTHING MORE NOT EVEN THE W RISTS TO WHICH IT MIGHT BE ATTACHED
6930-81414-0008 IT DID NOT BECKON OR INDEED MOVE AT ALL IT WAS AS STILL AS THE HAND OF DEATH
6930-81414-0009 I AWO TO CONSCIOUSNESS FIGHTING AT FIRST HIS SEEMED AS IF I WAS FIGHTING WITH THE PHANTOM BUT GRATUALLY MY OPPON IT BECAME MORE REAL TO ME IT WAS CAFVERER
6930-81414-0010 A SOUND OF VOICES A FLASH OF LIGHT
6930-81414-0011 A FEELING A FREEDOM AND I WAS AWAKE WHERE
6930-81414-0012 SAID IN MOOTHER VOICE WITH DI RECOUGNIZED F CHS CAFFER
6930-81414-0013 I HAD SCARCELY KNOWN WHEN I HAD BEEN SAYING OR DOING UP TO THIS TIME BUT AS HE SPOKE I LOOKED AT MY HAND
6930-81414-0014 IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON I SAW IN KNIFE RED WITH BLOOD AND MY HAND TOO WAS ALSO DISCLOORED
6930-81414-0015 I DO NOT KNOW I AM DAZED BEWILDERED
6930-81414-0016 WHAT THAT IS CA HIS LIIFE
6930-81414-0017 I KNOW HE HADED THIS VERYE EVENING
6930-81414-0018 I RMBERED SAYING HA WE BEEN TOGETHER
6930-81414-0019 OLD CHIR PICKED UP SOMETHING FROM THE GROUND AND LOOKED AT IT
6930-81414-0020 I SAY YOU DO KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS AND DO YOU MUST TELL US
6930-81414-0021 A TERRIBLE THOUGHT FLASHED INTO MY MIND
6930-81414-0022 I HAD AGAIN BEEN ACTING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THIS MAN'S POWER
6930-81414-0023 PORCHANCE TO CAVER'S DEATH MIGHT SERVE HIM AND GOOD STEAD
6930-81414-0024 MY TOUNGUE WEREFUSED TO OURTICULATE MY POWER OF SPEECH LAUGHED TO ME
6930-81414-0025 MY POSITION WAS TOO TERRIBLE
6930-81414-0026 MY OVERROUGHT NERVES YIELDED AT LAST
6930-81414-0027 FOR SOME TIME AFTER THAT I REMEMBERED NOTHING DISTINCTLY
7021-79730-0000 THE THREE MODES OF MANAGEMENT
7021-79730-0001 TO SUPPOSE THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS WORK IS TO AID IN AFFECTING SUCH OF SUBSTITUTION IS THAT IS ENTIRELY TO MISTAKE ITS NATURE AND DESIGN
7021-79730-0002 BY REASON AN AFFECTION
7021-79730-0003 AS THE CHAJS DRIVES AWY MERY STANDS BEWILDERED AND PERPLEXED ON THE DOOR STEP HER MIND IN A TUMULT OF EXCITEMENT IN WHICH HATRED OF THE DOCTOR DISTRUST AND SUSPICION OF HER MOTHER DEAPPOINTMENT VEXATION AND ILLC HUMOUR SERGE AND SWELL AMONG THOSE DELEGANT ORAN ASATION ON WHICH THESTRUCTURE AND THEVELOPMENT OF THE SO SO CLOSELY DEPEN DOING PERHAPS AND AREPARABLERDARY
7021-79730-0004 THE MOTHER AS SOON AS THE CHASE IS SO FAR TURNED THAT MARRY CAN NO LONGER WATCH THE EXPRESSION OFVER CONFINENCE GOES AWAY FROM THE DOOR WITH A SMILE OF COMPLAASENCY AND ANDISFACTION ON HER FACE AT THE INGENUITY ANCCESSS OF HER LITTLE ARTIFIC
7021-79730-0005 SO YOU WILL BE A GOOD GIRL I KNOW AND NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE BUT WILL STAY AT HOME CONTENDEDLY WON'T YOU
7021-79730-0006 THE MOTHER IN MANAGING THE CASE IN THIS WAY REALLYZED PARTLY ON CONVINCING THE REASON OF THE CHILD AND PARTLY ON AN APPEAL TO HER AFFECTION
7021-79730-0007 IF YOU SHOULD NOT BE A GOOD GIRL WHAT SHOULD SHOW SIGINS OF MAKING US ANY TROUBLE I SHALL HAVE TO SEND YOU OUT SOMEWHERE TO THE BACK PART OF THE HOUSE UNTIL WE ARE GOEN
7021-79730-0008 BUT THIS LAST SUPPOSITION IS ALMOST ALWAYS UNNECESSARY FOR IF MERRY HAS BEEN HABITUALLY MANAGED ON THIS PRINCIPLE SHE WILL NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE
7021-79730-0009 IT IS INDEED TRUE THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF TACT AND SKILL IN THE TRAINING OF THE YOUNG AND OF CULTIVATING THEIR REASON AND SECURING THEIR AFFECTION CAN NOT BEATED
7021-79740-0000 TO SUCH PERSONS THESE INDECT MODES OF TRAINING CHILDREN INHABITS OF SUBBORTINATION TO THEIR WILL OR RATHER OF YIELDING TO THEIR INFLUENCE ARE SPECIAL USEFUL
7021-79740-0001 DELAH HAD A YOUNG SIST NAMED MERIA AND A COUSIN WHOSE NAME WAS JANE
7021-79740-0002 NOW GILLIA CONTRIVE TO OBTAIN A GREAT INFLUENCE AND AS SENENCY OVER THE MINDS OF THE CHILDREN BY MEANS OF THESE DOLLS
7021-79740-0003 TO GIVE IDEA OF THESE CONVERSATIONS I WILL REPORT ONE OF THEM IN FULL
7021-79740-0004 YOU HAVE COME AND DELA AND DELAER WAS THE NAMEO ENE STALL TO MAKE ROSALLY OF VISIT
7021-79740-0005 I AM VERY GLAD
7021-79740-0006 I EXPECT YOU HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD GIRL AND DELA SINCE YOU HERE LAST
7021-79740-0007 THEN TURNINGED TO JANE SHE ASKED IN A SUWHAT ALTER TONE HAS SHEEP IN A G GIRL JANE
7021-79740-0008 FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN PLAYING UPON THE PIAS WITH BLOCKS AND OTHER PLAY THINGS AND FINALLY HAD GONE INTO THE HOUSE LEAVING ALL THE THINGS ON THE FLOOR OF THE PIASA INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM AWAY IN THEIR PLACES AS THEY OUGHT TO HAVE DONE
7021-79740-0009 THEY WERE NOW PLAYING WITH THEIR DOLLS IN THE PARLLOUR
7021-79740-0010 DELI CAME TO THE PARLOOR AND WITH AN AIR OF GREAT MYSTERY BECKON THE CHILDREN ASIDE AND SET TO THEM IN A WHISPER LEVE AND DELA AND ROSILY HERE AND DON'T SAYWARD THEM
7021-79740-0011 SO SAYING SHE LED THE WAY ON TIPTI FOLLOWED BY THE CHILDREN OUT OF THE ROOM AND RONED BY A SIRCOUOUS ROT TO THE PIZZA THERE
7021-79740-0012 SAID SHE POINTING THE PLAY THINGS SEE
7021-79740-0013 PUT THESE PLEY THINGS ALL AWAY QUICK AND CAREFULLY AND WE WILL NOT LET THEM NOM ANYTHING ABOUT  YOURURE LEAMING THEM OUTUN
7021-79740-0014 AND THIS METHOD OF TREATING THE CASE WAS MUCH MORE EFFECTUAL IN MAKING THEM DISPOSED TO AVOID COMMITTING A SIMILAR FAULT ANOTHER TIME THAN ANY DIRECT REBUKES OR EXPRESSIONS OF DISPLEASURE ADDRESS PERSIALLY TO THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN
7021-79759-0000 NATURE OF THE EFFECT PRODUCED BY EARLY IMPRESSIONS
7021-79759-0001 THAT IS COMPARATIVELY NOTHING
7021-79759-0002 THEY ARE CHIEFLY FORMED FROM COMMINATIONS OF THE IMPRESSIONS MADE IN CHILDHOOD
7021-79759-0003 VAST IMPORTANCE AND INFLUENCE OF THIS MENTAL FURNISHING
7021-79759-0004 WITHUT GOING TO ANY SUCH EXTREM IS THIS WE CAN EASILY SEE ON REFLECTION HOW VAST IN INFLUENCE ON THE IDEAS AND CONCEPTIONS AS WELL AS ON THE PRINCIPLES OF ACTION IN MATURE YEARS MUST BE EXERTED BY THE NATURE AND CHARACTER OF THE IMAGES WHICH THE PERIODIVE INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD IMPRESS UPON THE MIND
7021-79759-0005 THE PAIN PRODUCED BY AN ACT OF HASTY AND ANGRY VIOLENCE TO WHICH A FATHER SUBJECTS HIS SON MAY SOON PASS AWAY BUT THE MEMORY OF IT DOES NOT PASS AWAY WITH THE PAIN
7021-85628-0000 WHATERS CARED NOTHING ABOUT THAT
7021-85628-0001 HE MADE A B SO DEEP THAT HIS BACK CAME NEAR BREAKING AND HE WAS DUNE FOUNDED I CAN TELL YOU WHEN HE SAW IT WAS NOBODY BUT ANDERS
7021-85628-0002 HE WAS SUCH A BIG BOY THAT HE WOR HIGH BOOTS AND CARRIED A JACK KNIFE
7021-85628-0003 NOW THIS KNIFE WAS APLENDID ONE THOUGH HALF THE BLABE WAS GONE AND THE HANDLE WAS A LITTLE CRACKED AN ANDERSNEW THAT ONE IS ALMOST A MAN AS SOON AS ONE HAS A JACKNIFE
7021-85628-0004 YES WHY NOT THOUGHT ANDS
7021-85628-0005 SEE THAT I AM SO FIN I MAY AS WELL GO AND VISIT THE KING
7021-85628-0006 I AM GOING TO THE COURT BALL ANSWERED ANDERERS
7021-85628-0007 AND SHE TOOK AND'S HAND AND WALKED WITH HIM UP THE BROAD MARBLE STAIRS WHERE SOLDIERERS WEREPSTED AT EVERY THIRD STEP AND TH THE MAGNIFICANT HALLS WHERE COURTEERS IN SILK AND VELVEED STOOD BOWING WHERE EVER HE WENT
7021-85628-0008 FOR LIKE AS NOT THEY MUST HAVE THOUGHT HIM A PRINCE WHEN THEY SAW HIS FINE CAP
7021-85628-0009 AT THE FAARTHERND OF THE LARGEST HALL A TABLE WAS SET WITH GOLDEN CUPS AND GOLDEN PLATES IN LONG ROS
7021-85628-0010 ON HUGE SILVER PLATTERS WERE PERM OF TARTS AND CAKES AND RED WINE SPARKLED AND GLITTERING THE CHTERS
7021-85628-0011 THE PRINCESS SET DOWN UNDER A BLUE CAMOPY WITH BCZE OF ROSES AND SHE LET AND SIT IN A GOLD AND CHAIR BY HER SIDE
7021-85628-0012 BUT YOU MUST NOT EAT WITH YOUR CAMP ON YOUR HEAD SHE SAID AND WAS GOING TO THEY GET OFF
7021-85628-0013 THE PRINCESS CERTAINLY WAS BEAUTIFUL AND HE WOULD HAVE DEALLY LIKE TO BE GISSED BY HER BUT THE CAP WHICH IS MOTHER HAD MADE HE WOULD NOT GIVE UP ON ANY CONDITION
7021-85628-0014 HE ONLY SHOOK HIS HEAD
7021-85628-0015 WELL BUT MO SO SAID THE PRINCESS AND SHE FILLED HIS POCKETS WITH CAKES AND PUT HER OWN HEAVY GOLD CHAINE AROUND HIS NECK AND BENT DOWN AND KISSED HIM
7021-85628-0016 THAT IS A VERY FINE CAP YOU HAVE HE SAID
7021-85628-0017 SO IT IS SS
7021-85628-0018 AND IT IS MADE OF MOTHER'S BEST YN AND SHENITEDED HERSELF AND EVERYBODY ONCE TO GET IT AWAY FOR ME
7021-85628-0019 WITH ONE JUMP AND S GOT OUT OF HIS CHAIR
7021-85628-0020 HE DARTED LEG AN ARROW THROUGH ALL THE HALLS DOWN ALL THESTAIRS AND ACROSS THE YARD
7021-85628-0021 HE STILL HELD ON TO IT WITH BOVE HANDS AS HE RUSHED INTO HIS MOTHER'S COTTAGE
7021-85628-0022 AND ALL HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERERS STOOD ROUND AND LISTENED WITH THEIR MOUTHVES OPEN
7021-85628-0023 BUT WHEN HIS BIG BROTHER HEARD THAT HE HAD REFUSED TO GIVE HIS CAPT FOR A KINGS GOLDEN CROWN HE SAID THAT ANDERS WAS A STUPID
7021-85628-0024 ANDS FACE GREW RED
7021-85628-0025 BUT HIS MOTHER HUED IN CLOSE
7021-85628-0026 NO MY LITTLE FUN SHE SAID
7021-85628-0027 IF YOU DRESSED AND SIL AND GOLD FROM TOP TO T YOU COULD NOT LOOK ANY NICER THAN IN YOUR LITTLE RED CAP
7127-75946-0000 AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE BANQUET WHICH WAS SERVED IT FIVE O'CLOCK THE KING ENTER DIS CABINET WERE HIS TAILLORERS OR A WAITING HIM FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRYING ON THE CELEBRATED COSTUME REPRESENTING SPRING WHICH WAS THE RESULT OF SO MUCH IMAGINATION AND HAD COSTED SO MANY EFFORTS OF THOUGHT TO THE DESERS AND OR OF AN WORKERS OF THE COURKT

7127-75946-0002 LET HIM COME IN THEN SAID THE KING AND AS IF CALLBAR HAD BEEN LISENING AT THE DOOR FOR THE PURPOSE OF KEEPING HIMSELF A CORANT WITH THE CONVERSATION HE ENTERED ASSON AS THE KING HAD PRONOUNCED HIS NAME TO THE TWO QU YARERS

7127-75946-0013 THE KING HAD COMPLETED HIS TOILETT BY NINE O'CLOCK HE APPEARED IN AN OPEN CARRIAGED DECORATED WITH BRNCHES OF TREES AND FLOWERS
7127-75946-0014 THE QUEENS HAD TAKEN THEIR SEATS UPON A MAGNIFICENT DAYAS OR PLATFORM ERECTED UPON THE BORDERS OF THE LAKE IT A THEATRE OF WONDERFUL ELEGANCE OF CONSTRUCTION
7127-75946-0015 SUDDENLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESTORING PEACE AND ORDER SPRING ACCOMPANIED BY HIS HALE COURT MADE HIS APPEARANCE
7127-75946-0016 THE SEASONS ALLIES OF SPRING FOLLOWED HIM CLOSELY TO FORMER QUAD DREAL WHICH AFTER MANY WORDS OF MORE OR LESS FLATTERING IMPORT WAS THE COMMENCEDMENT OF THEANCE
7127-75946-0017 HIS LEGS THE BEST SHAPED AT COURT WERE DISPLAYED TO GREAT ADVANTAGE AND FLESH COURED SILKEN HOS A SILK SO FINE AND SO TRANSPARENT THAT IT SEEMED ALMOST LIKE FLESH ITSELF
7127-75946-0018 THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS CARRIAGE WHICH RESEMBLED THE BANT MOVEMENTS OF AN IMMORTAL AND HE DID NOT DANCE SO MUCH AS SEEMED TO SORE ALONG
7127-75946-0019 YES IT IS SUPPRESSED
7127-75946-0020 FAR FROM ITS SIRE YOUR MAJESTY HAVEN GIVEN NO DIRECTIONS ABOUT IT THE MUSICIS EVERYTDED

7127-75946-0024 MOSIERE WAS THE ONLY WAN WHO DID DID NOT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT THE MATTER
7127-75946-0025 THE BALL LA BEGAN THE EFFECT WAS MORE THAN BEAUTIFUL
7127-75946-0026 WHEN THE MUSIC BY ITS BURSTS OF MELODY CARRIED AWAY THESE ALEUSTRIOUSSTANCERERS WHEN THE SIMPLE UNTUTORED PANTAMAMN OF THAT PERIOD ONLY THE MORE NATURAL ON ACCUNT OF THE VERYANDIFFERENT ACTING OF THE AUGUSTACTORS HAD REACHED ITS COMMINATING POINT OF TRIUMPH THE THEATRE SHOOK WITH TUMULTUOUS A PPLAWES
7127-75946-0027 DISDINFUL OF A SUCCESS OF WHICH MADAME SHOWED NO ACKNOWLEDGMENT HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT BOLDLY REGINING THE MARKET PREFERENCE OF THE PRINCESS
7127-75946-0028 BY DEGREES ALL HIS HAPPINESS ALL HIS BRILLIANCY SUBSIDEIDED IN TO REGRET AND UNEASINESS SO THAT HIS LIMBS  LOST THEIR POWER HIS ARMS HUNG HEAVILY BY HIS SIDES AND HIS HEAD DROOPED AS THOUGH HE WAS STUPEFIED

7127-75947-0009 A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AFTERWARDS HE RETURNED TO THE THEATRE BUT IT WILL BE READILY BELIEVED THAT IT WAS ONLY A POWERFUL EFFORT OF REASON OVER HIS GREAT EXCITEMENT THAT ENABLED HIM TO GO BACK OR PERHAPS FOR LOVE IS THUS STRANGELY CONSTITUTED HE FOUNDED IMPOSSIBLE EVEN TO REMAIN MUCH LONGERER SEPARATED FROM THE PRESS OF ONE WHO HAD BROKEN HIS HEART

8230-279154-0004 THERE IS NOTELOGICAL IMPOSSIBILITY AND THE HIGHPOTHESIS THAT THE ROLLED SPRANG INTO BEING OF FIVE MINUTES AGO EXACTLY AS IF THIN WAS WITH THE POPULATION THAT REMEMBERED WHOLLLY UNREAL PAS
8230-279154-0005 ALL THAT I'M DOING IS TO USE ITS LOGICALTENABILITY AS A HELP IN THE ANALYSIS OF WHAT OCCURS WHEN WE REMEMBER
8230-279154-0006 THE BEHAVIORUROUS TO ATTEMPS TO MAKE PSYCHOLOGY A RECORD OF BEHAVIOUR HAS TO TRUST HIS MEMORY AND MAKING THAT THE RECORD
8230-279154-0007 HABIT IS A CONCEPT INVOLVING THE OCCURRENCE OF SIMILAR EVENTS AT DIFFERENT TIMES IF THE BEHAVOURST FILLS CONFIDED THAT THERE IS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS HABIT THAT CAN ONLY BE BECAUSEY TRUSTS HIS MEMORY WHEN IT ASSURES HIM THAT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER TS
8230-279154-0008 BUT I DO ARE NOT THINK SUCH AN EFFERENCE IS WARED
8230-279154-0009 OUR CONFIDENCE OR LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE ACCURACY OF A MEMORY IMAGE MUST IN FUNDAMENTAL CASES BE BAS UPON A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE IMAGE ITSELF SENS WE CANNOT EVOKE THE PASST BODILY AND COMPAR WITH THE PRESENT INMAGE
8230-279154-0010 WE SOMETIMES HAVE IMAGES THAT ARE BY NO MEANS PECULIAR LE VAGUE WHICH YET WE DO NOT TRUST FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF FATIGUE WE MAY SEE FRS FACE VIVIDLY AND CLEARLY BUT ORRIBLY DISTORTED
8230-279154-0011 SOME EMAGES LIKE SU SENSATIONS PHILL VERY FAMILIAR WHILE OTHERS FILL STRANGE
8230-279154-0012 FAMILIARITY IS A FILLING CAPABLE OF DEGRECE
8230-279154-0013 IN AN IMAGE OF A WELL KNOWN FACEFOR EXAMPLE SOME PARTS MAY FEEL MORE FAMILIAR THAN OTHERS WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE HAVE MORE BELIEF IN THE ACCURACY OF THE FAMILIAR PARTS THAN IN THAT OF THE UNFORMILIAR PARTS
8230-279154-0014 I COME NOW TO THE OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MEMORY IMAGES MUST HAVE IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
8230-279154-0015 THEY MUST HAVE SOME CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MAX US REGARD THEM AS REFERING TO MORE OR E LESS REMOTE PORTIONS OF THE PAST
8230-279154-0016 IN ACTUAL FACT THEIR AR DUBLACE VARIOUS FACTORS THAT CONCUR AND GIVING US THE FEILLING OF GREATER OR LESS REMOTENESS AND SOME REMEMBEREDT
8230-279154-0017 THERE MAY BE ESP SPECIFIC FILLING WHICH COULD BE CALLED THE FILLING OF PASTNESS ESPECIALLY WERE IMMEDIATE MEMORYIOUS CONCERNED
8230-279154-0018 THERE IS OF COURSE A DIFFERENTENCE BETWEEN KNOWING THE TEMPORAL RELATION OF A REMEMBERED EFF EVENENT TO THE PRESENT AND KNOWING THE TIME ORDER OF TWO REMEMBERED EVENTS
8230-279154-0019 IT WOULD SEEM THAT ONLY RATHER RECENT EVENTS CAN BE PLACED AT ALL ACCURLY BY MEANS OF FELLINGS GIVING THEIR TEIMMPORAL RELATION TO THE PRESENT BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT SUCH FEILLINGS MUST PLAY IN ASENTIAL PART IN THE PROCESS OF DATING REMEMBERED EVENTS
8230-279154-0020 IF WE HAD RETAINED THE SUBJECT OR ACT IN KNOWLEDGE THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF MEMORY WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPARATIVELY SIMPLE
8230-279154-0021 REMEMBERING HAS TO BE AP PRESENT OCCURRENCE AND SOME WAY RESEMBLING OR LATED TO WHAT IS REMEMBERED
8230-279154-0022 SOME POINTS MAY BE TAKEN AS FIXED AND SUCH AS ANY THORY OF MEMBORY MUST ARRIVEH
8230-279154-0023 IN THIS CASE AS IN MOST OTHERS WHAT MAY BE TAKEN A CERTAIN IN ADVANCE IS RATHER VA
8230-279154-0024 THE FIRST OF OUR VAGU BUT ENDUBITABLE DATA IS E OTHER IS KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
8230-279154-0025 WE MIGHT PROVISIONALLY THE PERHAPS NOT QUITE CORRECTLY DE FINE MEMORY AS THAT WAY OF KNOWING ABOUT THE PASST WHICH HAS NO ANLOGUE IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE FUTURE SUCH A DEFINI WOULD AT LEAST SERVE TO MARK THE PROBLEM WITH WHICH WE ARE CONCERNED THOUGH SOME EXPECTATIONS MA DESERVE TO RANQ WITH MEMORY AS REGARDS IMMEDIIOUSY
8230-279154-0026 THIS DISINCTION IS VIAL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF MEMORY BUT IT IS NOT SO EASY TO CARRY OUT IN PRACTICE AS IT IS TO DRAW IN THEORY
8230-279154-0027 A GRANMAPHONE BY THE  HELP OFS SUUITABLE RECORDS MIGHT RELT TO US THE INCIDS OF ITS PASS AND PEOPLE ARE NOT SO DIFFERENT FROM GRANMISHONES AS THEY LIKED TO BELIEVE
8230-279154-0028 I CANSET TO WORK NOW TO REMEMBER THINGS I NEVER REMEMBERED BEFORE SUCH AS WHAT I HAD TO E FOR BREAKFAST THE MORNING AND IT CAN HARDLY BE WHOLLY HABIT THAT ENABLES ME TO DO THIS
8230-279154-0029 THE FACT THAT A MAN CAN REC OPM DOES NOT SHOW THAT HE REMEMBERS ANY PREVIOUS OCCASION ON WHICH HE HAS RESIDEED OR READ IT
8230-279154-0030 SIMMENS TWO BOOKS MENTIONED IN AN EARLIER LUCTURE DO NOT TOUCH KNOWLEDGE MEMORY AT ALL CLOSELY
8230-279154-0031 THEY GIVE  LAAWLLS ACCORDING TO WHICH EMAGES OF PASCURENCES COME INTO OUR MINS BUT DO NOT DISCUSS OUR BELIEVE THAT THESE IMAGES REFER TO PASSCCURRENCES WHICH IS WHAT CONSTITUES KNOWLEDGE MEMORY
8230-279154-0032 IT IS THIS THAT IS OF VTEREST TO THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE
8230-279154-0033 IT IS BY NO MEANS ALWAYS RELIABLE ALMOST E EVERYBODY HAS IT SOMET EXPERIIOUS THE WELL NOTN ILLUSION THAT ALL THAT HIS HAPPENING NOW HAPPENED BEFORE AT SOMET
8230-279154-0034 WHENEVER THE SENSE OF FAMILIARITY OCCURS WITHOUT A DEFINIT OBJE IT LES US TO SEARCH THE ENVIREMENTS UNTIL WE SATISFY THAT WE HAVE FOUND THE APPROPRIATE OBJECT WHICH LES UST TO THE JUDGMENT THIS IS FAMILIAR
8230-279154-0035 THUS NO KNOWLEDGE AS TO THE PAST IS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE FELLING OF FAMILIARITY ALONE
8230-279154-0036 OF FURTHER STAGE IS RECOGNITION
8230-279154-0037 RECOGNITION IN VIISENCE DOES NOT MECESSARILY INVOLVE MORE THAT A HABIT OF ASOCIATION THE KIND OF OBJECT WE ARE SEEING AT THE MOMENT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORD CAT OR WITH AN AUTITORY IMMAGE OF PURING OR WHATEVER OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WE MAY HAPPENED TO RECOGNIZE IN THE CAP OF THE MOMENT
8230-279154-0038 WE ARE OF COURSE IN FACT ABLE TO JUDGE WHEN WE RECOGNIZE AND OBJECT THAT WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE BUT THIS JUDGMENT SOMETHING OVER AND ABOVE RECNIISSION IN THIS FIRST SENS AND MAY VERY PROBAICBLY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ANIMALS THAT NEVERTHELESS HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF RECOGNITION AND THIS FIRST S OF THE WORD
8230-279154-0039 THIS KNOWLEDGE IS MEMORY AND ONE CENSE THOUGH IN ANOTHER IT IS NOT
8230-279154-0040 THERE ARE HOWEVER SEVERAL POINTS IN WHICH SUCH AN ACCCOUNT OF RECOGNITION IS AN ATATEQUATE TO BEGIN WITH IT MIGHT SEEM OF FIRST SIGHT MORE CORRECT TO DE FINE RECOGNITION AS I HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE THAN AS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE
8230-279154-0041 THE DEFINI OF MY EXPERIENCE IS DIFFICULT BROADLY SPEAKING IT IS E EVERYTHING THAT IS CONNECTED WITH WHAT I AM EXPERIENCEING NOW BY CERTAIN LENKS OF WHICH THE VARIOUS FORMS OF MEMORY ARMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT
8230-279154-0042 THUS IF I RECOGNIZE OF THING THE OCCASION OF ITS PREVIOUS EXISTENCE AND VIRTUE OF WHICH I RECOGNIZE IT FORMS PART OF MY EXPERIENCE BY DEFINITION RECOGNITION WILL BE ONE OF THE MARKS BY WHICH MY EXPERIENCE IS SINGLE DO FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD
8230-279154-0043 OF COURSE THE WORDS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE ARE A VERY INADEQUATE TRANSLATION OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHEN WE FORM A JUDGMENT OF RECOGNITION BUT THAT IS UNAVOIDABLE WORDS ARE FRAMED TO EXPRESS A LEVEL OF THOUGHT WHICH IS BY NOMAN'S PMITATIVE AND ARE QUITE AND CAPABLE OF EXPRESSING SUCH AN ELEMENTARY OCCURRENCE AS IT RECOGNITION
8455-210777-0000 I REMAIN THEIRLONE FOR MANY HOURS BUT A MUSTCKNOWALLS THAT BEFORE LEFT THE CHAMERS I HAD GRADUALLY BROUGHT MYSELF TO LOOK AT THE MATTER AND ANOTHER LIGHT
8455-210777-0001 HAD EVER CRUSWELLER NOT BEEN GOOD LOOKING HAD JACK STILL A COLLEGE HAD CIRCENTON O OVER THE REMAINED IN ENGLAND HAD MISTER BUNNET THAN THE BARKEEPER NOT SUCCEEDED AND STOPPY MY CARRIAGE ON THE HILL I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN A RAADY FOR THE FINALD THE PARTURE OF MYLE FRIEND

8455-210777-0004 I HAVE COME TO YOURSURES MISTER PRESIDENT WITH THE PURPOSE OF SEEING HOW THINGS ARE PROGRESSING IN THE THIS DISIN QUARTER OF THE WORLD
8455-210777-0005 WE HAVE OUR LITTLE SHRUGGS HERE AS ELSEWHERE AND ALL THS CANNOT BE DONE BY ROSE WA

8455-210777-0010 THEIR MAST SAID MISSUS NEVER BE

8455-210777-0017 MY WIFE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT MANISH TO GIVE THE GENTLEMEN A VERY GOOD DINNER
8455-210777-0018 THIS SHE SAID WAS TRUE HOSPITALITY AND I AM NOT SURE THAT DID NOT AGREE WITH THERE
8455-210777-0019 THEN THERE WERE THREE OR FOUR LEADING MEN OF THE COMMUNITY WITH THEIR WIVES WHO WERE FOR THE MOST PART THE FATHERS AND MOTHERS OF THE YOUNG LADIES
8455-210777-0020 OH YES SAID JACK THEN I'M KNOWHERE
8455-210777-0021 BUT I MEAN TO HAVE MY ENNES BEFORE LONG
8455-210777-0022 OF WHAT MISSUS NEVER BEEN HAD GONE THROUGH AND PROVIDING BIRDS BEASTS AND FISHES NOT TO TALK OF TARTS AND JEALIES FOR THE DINNER OF THAT DAY NO ONE BUT MYSELF CAN HAVE ANY IDEA BUT IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT SHE ACCOMPLISHED HER TASK WITH THOROUGHOW SUCCESS
8455-210777-0023 WE SAT WHAT THE OFFICER SOME LITTLE TIME AFTER DINNER AND THEN WHEN A SHORE
8455-210777-0024 HOW MUCH OF EVIL A REAL ACCOMPLISHED EVIL HAD THERE NOT OCCURRED TO ME DING THE LAST FEW DAYS

8455-210777-0028 JACK WOULD BECOME EVENS HAPPY HUSBAND AND WOULD REMAIN AM MIST THE HURRIED DUTIES OF THE EAGER WORLD
8455-210777-0029 THINKING OF ALL THIS I WENT TO SLEE
8455-210777-0030 MISTER NEVER BENDD BEGAN THE CAPTAIN AND I OBSERVEED THAT UP TO THAT MOMENT HE A GENERALLY ADRESSED ME AS PRESIDENT THE CANNOT BE DENIED THAT WE HAVE COME HERE ON AN UNPLEASANTIT MISSION
