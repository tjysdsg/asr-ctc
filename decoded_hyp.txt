1089-134686-0000 HE HOPED THERE WOULD BE STOOL FOR DINNER TURNIPS AND CARROTS AND BRUISED POTATOES AND FAT MUTTONPIECES TO BE LAIDLED OUT IN THICK PEPPERED FLOWER FAT AND SAUCE
1089-134686-0001 STUFFID INTO YOU HIS BELLY COUNCILED HIM
1089-134686-0002 AFTER EARLY NIGHTFALL THE YELLOW LAMPS WOULD LIGHT UP HERE AND THERE THE SQUALLEID QUARTER OF THE BRAOFLES
1089-134686-0003 LL BERTY ANY GOOD IN YOUR MIND
1089-134686-0004 NUMBER DEIN FRESH NELIA IS WAITING ON YOU GOOD NIGHT HUSBAND
1089-134686-0005 THE MUSIC CAME NEARER AND HE RECALLED THE WORDS THE WORDS OF SHELLY'S FRAGMENT UPON THE MOON WANDERING COMPANIONS PALE FOR WEARINESS
1089-134686-0006 THE DULL LIGHT FELL MORE FAINTLY UPON THE PAGE WHEREON ANOTHER REQUATION BEGAN TO UN FOLD ITSELF SLOWLY AND TO SPREAD ABOAD ITS WIDENING TAIL
1089-134686-0007 A COLDLUCED INDIFFERENCE REIGNED IN HIS SOUL
1089-134686-0008 THE CHAOS IN WHICH HIS ARDOR EXTINGUISHED ITSELF WAS A COLD INDIFFERENT KNOWLEDGE OF HIMSELF
1089-134686-0009 AT MOST BY AN ALMS GIVEN TO A BEGGAR WHOSE BLESSING HE FLED FROM HE MIGHT HOPE WEARILY TO WIN FOR HIMSELF SOME MEASURE OF ACTUAL GRACE
1089-134686-0010 WELL NOW ENIS I DECLARE YOU HAVE A HEAD AND SO HAS MY STICK
1089-134686-0011 ON SATURDAY MORNINGS WHEN THE SO DOUALT HE MET IN THE CHAPEL TO RECIT THE LITTLE OFFICE HIS PLACE WAS A CUSHIONED KNEELING DESK AT THE RIGHT OF THE ALTAR FROM WHICH HE LED HIS WING OF BOYS THROUGH THE RESPONSES
1089-134686-0012 HER EYES SEEMED TO REGARD HIM WITH MILD PITY HER HOLINESS A STRANGE LIGHT GLOWING FAINTLY UPON HER FRAIL FLESH DID NOT HUMILIATE THE SINNER WHO APPROACHED HER
1089-134686-0013 IF EVER HE WAS IMPELLED TO CASTS IN FROM HIM AND TO REPENT THE IMPULSE THAT MOVED HIM WAS THE WISH TO BE HER NIGHT
1089-134686-0014 HE TRIED TO THINK HOW WOULD COULD BE
1089-134686-0015 BUT THE DUSK DEEPENING IN THE SCHOOLROOM COVERED OVER HIS THOUGHTS THE BELL RANG
1089-134686-0016 THEN YOU CAN ASK HIM QUESTIONS ON THE CATECHISM DE ATALIST
1089-134686-0017 STEPHEN LEANING BACK AND DRAWING EYDELY ON HIS SCRIBBLER LISTENED TO THE TALK ABOUT HIM WHICH HARENT CHECKED FROM TIME TO TIME BY SAYING
1089-134686-0018 IT WAS STRANGE TO THAT HE FOUND AN ARID PLEASURE IN FOLLOWING UP TO THE END THE RIGID LINES OF THE DOCTRINES OF THE CHURCH AND PENETRATING INTO OBSCURE SILENCES ONLY TO HEAR AND FEEL THE MORE DEEPLY HIS OWN CONDEMNATION
1089-134686-0019 THE SENTENCE OF SAINT JAMES WHICH SAYS THAT HE WHO OFFENDS AGAINST ONE COMMANDMENT BECOMES GUILTY OF ALL HAD SEEMED TO HIM FIRST A SWOLLEN PHRASE UNTIL HE HAD BEGUN TO GROP IN THE DARKNESS OF HIS OWN STATE
1089-134686-0020 IF A MAN HAD STOLEN A POUND IN HIS YOUTH AND HAD USED THAT POUND TO A MASSA HUGE FORTUNE HOW MUCH WAS HE OBLIGED TO GIVE BACK THE POUND HE HAD STOLEN ONLY WERE THE POUND TOGETHER WITH THE COMPOUND INTEREST A CREWING UPON IT OR ALL HIS HUGE FORTUNE
1089-134686-0021 IF A LAMMENT IN GIVING BAPTISM POUR THE WATER BEFORE SAYING THE WORDS IS THE CHILD BAPTIZED
1089-134686-0022 HOW COMES IT THAT WHILE THE FIRST BE ATTITUDE PROMISES THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN TO THE POOR OF HEART THE SECOND BE ATTITUDE PROMISES ALSO TO THE MEEK THAT THEY SHALL POSSESS THE LAND
1089-134686-0023 WHY WAS THE SACRAMENT OF THE  EUCORIST INSTITUTED UNDER THE TWO SPECIES OF BREAD AND WINE IF JESUS CHRIST BE PRESENT BODY AND BLOOD SOUL AND DIVINITY IN THE BRAD ALONE AND IN THE WINE ALONE
1089-134686-0024 IF THE WINE CHANGE TO VINEGAR AND THE HOST CRUMBLE INTO CORRUPTION AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN CONSECRATED IS JESUS CHRIST STILL PRESENT UNDER THEIR SPECIES AS GOD AND AS MAN
1089-134686-0025 A GENTLE KICK FROM THE TALL BOY IN THE BENCH BEHIND URGED STEPHEN TO ASK A DIFFICULT QUESTION
1089-134686-0026 THE RECTOR DID NOT ASK FOR ACHATEICISM TO HEAR THE LESSON FROM
1089-134686-0027 HE CLASPED HIS HANDS ON THE DESK AND SAID
1089-134686-0028 THE RETREAT WILL BEGIN ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON IN HONOR OF SAINT FRANCESZVIOUR WHOSE FEAST DAY IS SATURDAY
1089-134686-0029 ON FRIDAY CONFESSION WILL BE HEARD ALL THE AFTERNOON AFTER BEADS
1089-134686-0030 BEWARE OF MAKING THAT MISTAKE
1089-134686-0031 STEPHEN'S HEART BEGUN SLOWLY TO FOL AND FADED WITH FEAR LIKE A WITHERING FLOWER
1089-134686-0032 HE IS CALLED AS YOU KNOW THE APOSTLE OF THE INDIES
1089-134686-0033 A GREAT SAINT SAINT FRCIS AT ZVIER
1089-134686-0034 THE RECTOR PAUSED AND THEN SHAKING HIS CLASP TO HANDS BEFORE HIM WENT ON
1089-134686-0035 HE HAD THE FAITH IN HIM THAT MOVE'S MOUNTAINS
1089-134686-0036 A GREAT SAINT SAINT FRANCISZVIERUR
1089-134686-0037 IN THE SILENCE THEIR DARK FIRE KINDLED THE DUSK INTO A TAWONY GLOW
1089-134691-0000 HE COULD WAIT NO LONGER
1089-134691-0001 FOR A FULL HOUR HE HAD PACED UP AND DOWN WAITING BUT HE COULD WAIT NO LONGER
1089-134691-0002 HE SET OFF ABRUPTLY FOR THE BUL WALKING RAPIDLY LEST HIS FATHER'S SHRILL WHISTLE MIGHT CALL HIM BACK AND IN A FEW MOMENTS HE HAD ROUNDED THE CURVE AT THE POLICE BARRACK AND WAS SAFE
1089-134691-0003 THE UNIVERSITY
1089-134691-0004 BRIDE AFTER SATISFACTION UPLIFTED HIM LIKE LONG SLOW WAVES
1089-134691-0005 WHOSE FEET ARE AS THE FEET OF HEARTS AND UNDERNEATH THE EVERLASTING ARMS
1089-134691-0006 THE PRIDE OF THAT DIM IMAGE BROUGHT BACK TO HIS MIND THE DIGNITY OF THE OFFICE HE HAD REFUSED
1089-134691-0007 SOON THE WHOLE BRIDGE WAS TREMBLING AND RESOUNDING
1089-134691-0008 THE UNCOUTH FACES PASSED HIM TO BY TWO STAIN YELLOW OR READ OR LIV IT BY THE SEA AND AS HE STROVE TO LOOK AT THEM WITH EASE AND INDIFFERENCE A FAINT STAIN OF PERSONAL SHAME AND COMMSERATION ROSE TO HIS OWN FACE
1089-134691-0009 ANGRY WITH HIMSELF HE TRIED TO HIDE HIS FACE FROM THEIR EYES BY GAZING DOWN SIDEWAYS INTO THE SHALLOW SWIRLING WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE BUT HE STILL SAW A REFLECTION THEREIN OF THEIR TOP HEAVY SILK CATS AND HUMBLE TAPE LIKE COLLARS AND LOOSELY HANGING CLERICAL CLOTHES BROTHER HICKY
1089-134691-0010 BROTHER ME CARDO BROTHER KV
1089-134691-0011 THEIR PIETY WOULD BE LIKE THEIR NAMES LIKE THEIR FACES LIKE THEIR CLOTHES AND WAS IDLE FOR HIM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT THEIR HUMBLE AND CONTRTE HEARTS IT MIGHT BE PAID A FAR RICHARD TRIBUTE OF DEVOTION THAN HIS HAD EVER BEEN A GIFT TENFOLD MORE ACCEPTABLE THAN HIS ELABORATE ADORATION
1089-134691-0012 IT WAS IDLE FOR HIM TO MOVE HIMSELF TO BE GENEROUS TOWARDS THEM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT IF HE EVER CAME TO THEIR GATES STRIPPED OF HIS PRIDE BEATEN AND IN BEGGAR'S WEEDS THAT THEY WOULD BE GENEROUS TOWARDS HIM LOVING HIM AS THEMSELVES
1089-134691-0013 IDLE AND EMBITTERING FINALLY TO ARGUE AGAINST HIS OWN DISPASSIONATE SERTITUDE THAT THE COMMANDMENT OF LOVE BADE US NOT TO LOVE OUR NEIGHBOUR AS OURSELVES WITH THE SAME AMOUNT AND INTENSITY OF LOVE BUT TO LOVE HIM AS OURSELVES WITH THE SAME KIND OF LOVE
1089-134691-0014 THE PHRASE AND THE DAY AND THE SCENE HARMONIZED IN ACCORD
1089-134691-0015 WORDS WAS IT THEIR COLORS
1089-134691-0016 THEY WERE VOYAGING ACROSS THE DESERTS OF THE SKY A HOST OF NO MADS ON THE MARCH VOYAGING A HIGH OVER IRELAND WESTWARD BOUND
1089-134691-0017 THE EUROPE THEY HAD COME FROM LAY OUT THERE BEYOND THE IR SEA EUROPE OF STRANGE TONGUES AND VALLED ANDOOD BEGIRT AND SIT AADEL AND OF ENTRENCHED AND MARSHALED RACES
1089-134691-0018 AGAIN AGAIN
1089-134691-0019 A VOICE FROM BEYOND THE WORLD WAS CALLING
1089-134691-0020 HULLO STUFFANS HERE COMES THE DEBLALESS
1089-134691-0021 THEIR DIVING STONE POISED ON ITS ROUDE SUPPORTS AND ROCKING UNDER THEIR PLUNGES AND THE ROUGH HUM STONES OF THE SLOPING BREAKWATER OVER WHICH THEY SCRAMBLED IN THEIR HORSE PLAY GLEAMED WITH COLD WEFT LUSTTER
1089-134691-0022 HE STOOD STILL INDEFERENCE TO THEIR CALLS AND PARRIED THEIR BANTER WITH EASY WORDS
1089-134691-0023 IT WAS A PAIN TO SEE THEM AND A SWORD LIKE PAIN TO SEE THE SIGNS OF ADOLESCENCE THAT MADE REPLLENT THEIR PITIABLE NAKEDNESS
1089-134691-0024 STEUFFANONES DEAD LOS
1089-134691-0025 A MOMENT BEFORE THE GHOST OF THE ANCIENT KINGDOM OF THE DANS HAD LOOKED FORTH THROUGH THE VESTURE OF THE HAZRAP CITY
1188-133604-0000 YOU WILL FIND ME CONTINUALLY SPEAKING OF FOUR MEN TITION WHOLEBINE TURNER AND CANIN CUT AT AND ALMOST THE SAME TERMS
1188-133604-0001 THEY UNIT EVERY QUALITY AND SOMETIMESU WILL FIND ME REFERIN TO THEM AS COLORISTS SOMETIMESES KEURE SCURSTS
1188-133604-0002 BY BEING STUDIOUS OF COLOR THEY ARE STUDIOUS OF DIVISION AND WHILE THE CURESCURIOUS DEVOTES HIMSELF TO THE REPRESENTATION OF DEGREES OF FORCE AND ONE THING UNSEPARATED LIGHT THE COLORISTS HAVE FOR THEIR FUNCTION THEY ATTAIN IN A BEAUTY BY ARRANGEMENT OF THE DIVISIONS OF LIGHT
1188-133604-0003 MY FIRST PRINCIPAL REASON WAS THAT THEY ENFORCED BEYOND ALL RESISTANCE ON ANY STUDENT WHOM MIGHT ATTEMPT A COPY THEM THIS METHOD OF LAYING PORTIONS OF DISTINCT HUGH SIDE BY SIDE
1188-133604-0004 SOME OF THE TOUCHES INDEED WHEN THE TINT HAS BEEN MIXED WITH MUCH WATER HAVE BEEN LAID IN LITTLE DROPS OR PONDS SO THAT THE PIGGMENT MIGHT CRISTAL AS HARD AT THE EDGE
1188-133604-0005 ES THE HEAD OF A PARROT WITH A LITTLE FLOWER IN HIS BEAK FROM A PICTURE OF CARPOATSEIOS ONE OF HIS SERIES OF THE LIFE OF SAINT GEORGE
1188-133604-0006 THEN HE COMES TO THE BEEAK OF IT
1188-133604-0007 THE BROWN GROUND BENEATH HIS LEFT FOR THE MOST PART ONE TOUCH A BLACK AS PUT FOR THE HOLLOW T TO DELICATE LINES OF DARK GRAREY TO FIND THE OUTER CURVE AND ONE LITTLE QUIVERING TOUCH OF WHITE DRAWS THE INNER EDGE OF THE MANDABLE
1188-133604-0008 FOR BELIEVE ME THE FIN OF PHILOSOPHY OF ART CAN ONLY RATIFY THEIR OPINION THAT THE BEAUTY OF A COCK ROBIN IS TO BE READ AND OF A GRASS PLOT TO BE GREEN AND THE BEST SKILL ART IS AN INSTANTLY SEIZING ON THE MANIFOLD DELICIOUSNESS OF LIGHT WHICH YOU CAN ONLY SEES BY PRECISION OF INSTANTANEOUS TOUCH
1188-133604-0009 NOW YOU WILL SEE IN THESE STUDIES THAT THE MOMENT THE WHITE IS ENCLOSED PROPERLY AND HARMONIZED WITH THE OTHER HUES IT BECOME SOMEHOW MORE PRECIOUS AND PEARLY THAN THE WHITE PAPER AND THAT I AM NOT AFRAID TO LEAVE A WHOLE FIELD OF UNTREATED WHITE PAPER ALL ROUND IT BEING SURE THAT EVEN THE LITTLE DIAMONDS AND THE ROUND WINDOW WILL TELL IS JEWELS IF THEY AGREDATED JUSTLY
1188-133604-0010 BUT INISFIN YET COPIED FROM TURNER YOU HAVE THE TWO PRINCIPLES BROUGHT OUT PERFECTLY
1188-133604-0011 THEY ARE BEYOND ALL OTHER WORKS THAN I KNOW EXISTING DEPENDENT FOR THEIR EFFECT ON LOW SUBDUED TONES THEIR FAVOURITE CHOIC IN TIME OF DAVING EITHER DAWN OR TWILIGHT AND EVEN THEIR BRIGHT AS SUNSETS PRODUCED CHIEFLY OUT OF GRA PAPER
1188-133604-0012 IT MAY BE THAT A GREAT COLORLESS WILL USE HIS UTMOST FORCE OF COLOR AS A SINGER HIS FULL POWER OF VOICE BUT LOUD OR LOW THE VIRTUEES IN BOTH CASEES ALLLWAY WAS IN REFINEMENT NEVER IN LOUDNESS
1188-133604-0013 IT MUST REMEMBER BE ONE OR THE OTHER
1188-133604-0014 DO NOT THEREFORE THINK THAT THE GOTHIC SCHOOLS AN EASY ONE
1188-133604-0015 THE LA OF THAT SCHOOLS THAT EVERYTHING SHALL BE SEEN CLEARLY AT LEAST ONLY IN SUCH MISTER FAINTNESS AS SHALL BE DELIGHTFUL AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE BEST INTRODUCTION TO IT WOULD BE THE ELEMENTARY PRACTICE OF PAINTING EVERY STUDY ON A GOLDEN GROUND
1188-133604-0016 THIS AT ONCE COMPELS YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE WORK IS TO BE IMAGINATIVE AND DECORATIVE THAT IT REPRESENTS BEAUTIFUL THINGS IN THE CLEAREST WAY BUT NOT UNDER EXISTING CONDITIONS AND THAT IN FACT YOUR PRODUCING JEWELLERS WORK RATHER THAN PICTURES
1188-133604-0017 THAT A STYLES RESTRAINED OR SEVERE DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT IS ALSO ERONEOUS
1188-133604-0018 IN ALL EARLY GOTHIC ART INDEED YOU WILL FIND FAILURE OF THIS KIND ESPECIALLY DISTORTION AND RIGIDITY WHICH ARE IN MANY RESPECT PAINFULLY TO BE COMPARED WITH THE SPLENDID REPOSE OF CLASSIC ART
1188-133604-0019 THE LARGE LETTER CONTAINS INDEED ENTIRELY FEEBLE AND ILL DRAWN FIGURES THAT IS MERELY CHILDISH AND FAILING WORK OF AN INFIRE HAND IT IS NOT CHARACTERISTIC OF GOOTHOLIC OR ANY OTHER SCHOOL
1188-133604-0020 BUT OBSERVE YOU CAN ONLY DO THIS ON ONE CONDITION THAT OF STRIVING ALSO TO CREATE IN REALITY THE BEAUTY WHICH YOU SEEK IN IMAGINATION
1188-133604-0021 IT WILL BE WHOLL IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO RETAIN THE TRANQUILLITY OF TEMPER AND FELICITY OF FAITH NECESSARY FOR NOBLE PUREST PAINTING UNLESS YOU ARE ACTIVELY ENGAZED AND PROMOTING THE FELICITY AND PIECE OF PRACTICAL LIFE
1188-133604-0022 YOU MUST LOOK AT HIM IN THE FACE FIGHT HIM CONQUER HIM WITH WHAT SCAVE YOU MAY YOU NEED NOT THINK TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF HIM
1188-133604-0023 THE COLORIST SAYS FIRST OF ALL AS MY DELICIOUS PARQUET WAS RUBY SO THIS NASTY VIPRA SHALL BE BLACK AND THEN IS THE QUESTION CAN I ROUND HIM OFF EVEN THOUGH HE IS BLACK AND MAKE HIM SLIMY AND YET SPRINGING AND CLOSE DOWN CLOTTED LIKE A POOL OF BLACK BLOOD ON THE EARTH ALL THE SAME
1188-133604-0024 NOTHING WILL BE MORE PRECIOUS TO YOU I THINK IN THE PRACTICAL STUDY OF ART THAN THE CONVICTION WHICH WILL FORCE ITSELF ON NE MORE THAN MORE EVERY HOUR OF THE WAY ALL THINGS ARE BOUND TOGETHER LITTLE AND GREAT IN SPIRIT AND IN MATTER
1188-133604-0025 YOU KNOW I HAVE JUST BEEN TELLING YOU HOW THE SCHOOL MATERIALISM AND CLAY INVOLVEED ITSELF AT LAST AND CLOUD AND FIRE
1188-133604-0026 HERE'S AN EQUALLY TYPICAL GREEK SCHOOL LANDSCAPE BY WILSON LOST HOLLY AND GOLDEN MIST THE TREES SO SLIGHTLY DRAWN THAT YOU DON'T KNOW IF THEIR ARE TREES OR TOWERS AND NO CARE FOR COLOR WHATSOEVER PERFECTLY DECEPTED IN MARVELOOUS EFFECT OF SUNSHINE THROUGH THE MIST APOLLO IN THE PITHFONE
1188-133604-0027 NOW HERE IS RAPH IOW EXACTLY BETWEEN THE TWO TREES STILL DRAWN LEAF BY LEAF WHOLLY FORMAL BUT BEAUTIFUL MIST COMOMING GRADUALLY INTO THE DISTANCE
1188-133604-0028 WHIL THEN LAST HERE IS TURNS GREEK SCHOOL OF THE HIGHEST CLASS AND YOU TOFIND HIS ART ABSOLUTELY AS FIRST THE DISPLAYING INTENSELY AND WITH THE STERNAST INTELLECT OF NATURAL FORM AS IT IS AND THE IN THE INVELOPMENT OF IT WITH CLOUD AND FIRE
1188-133604-0029 ONLY THERE ARE TWO SORTS OF CLOUD AND FIRE
1188-133604-0030 HE KNOWS THEM BTH
1188-133604-0031 THERE'S ONE AND THERE'S ANOTHER THE DUDLY IN THE FLINT
1188-133604-0032 IT IS ONLY UP PENCIL OUTLNEED BY EDWARD BURN JOHNES IN ILLUSTRATION OF THE STORY OF PSYCHE IT IS THE INTRODUCTION OF PSYCHE AFTER ALL HER TROUBLES TO HEAVEN
1188-133604-0033 EVERY PLANT IN THE GRASS IS SET FORMERLY GROWS PERFECTLY AND MAY BE REALIISED COMPLETELY
1188-133604-0034 EXQUISITE ORDER AND UNIVERSAL WITH ETERNAL LIFE AND LIGHT THIS IS THE FAITH AN EFFORT OF THE SCHOOLS OF CRYSTEL AND YOU MAY DESCRIBE AND COMPLETE THEIR WORK QUITE LITERALLY BY TAKING ANY VERSES OF CHOSSER IN HIS TENDER MOOD AND OBSERVING HOW HE INSISTS ON THE CLEARNESS AND BRIGHTNESS FIRST AND THEN ON THE O ORDER
1188-133604-0035 THUS AND CHASS DREAM
1188-133604-0036 IN BOTH THESE HIGH METHICAL SUBJECTS THE SURROUNDING NATURE TH THOUGH SUFFERING IS STILL DIGNIFIED AND BEAUTIFUL
1188-133604-0037 EVERY LINE IN WHICH THE MASTER TRACES IT EVEN WERE SEEMINGLY NEGLEGENT AS LOVELY AND SET DOWN WITH A MEDITATEIVE CALMNESS WHICH MAKES THESE TWOEDCHINGS CAPABLE OF BEING PLACED BESIDE THE MOST TRANQUIL WORK OF WHOLEBIND OR DUR
1188-133604-0038 BUT NOW HERE IS A SUBJECT OF WHICH YOU WILL WONDER AT FIRST WHYE TURNER DRE IT AT ALL
1188-133604-0039 IT HAS NO BEAUTY WHATSOEVER NO SPECIALTY OF PICTURESQUENESS AND ALL ITS LINES ARE CRAMPED AND POOR
1188-133604-0040 THE CRAMNESS AND THE POVERTY ARE ALL INTENDED
1188-133604-0041 IT IS A GLEANER BRINGING DOWN HER ONE SHEIEF OF CORN TO AN OLD WATER MILL ITSELF MOSSY AND RENT SCARCELY ABLE TO GET ITS STONES TO TURN
1188-133604-0042 THE SCENE IS ABSOLUTELY ARCADIAN
1188-133604-0043 SEE THAT YOUR LIES BE IN NOTHING WORSE THAN A BOYS CLIMING FOR HIS ENTANGLED KIGHT
1188-133604-0044 IT WILL BE WELL FOR YOU IF YOU JOINED NOT WITH THOSE WHO INSTEAD OF KIGHTS FLY FALKINS WHO INSTEAD OF OBEY THE LAST WORDS OF THE GREAT CLOUD SHEPHERD DEFEAT HIS SHEEP LIVED THE LIVES HOW MUCH LESS THAN VANITY OF THE WARWOLF AND THE GAREAGLE

121-127105-0025 THE DEPARTING LADIES WHO SAID THEY WOULD STAY DID'T OF COURSE THANK HEAVEN STAY THEY DEPARTED IN CONSEQUENCE OF ARRANGEMENTS MADE IN A RAGE OF CURIOSITY AS THEY PROFESSED PRODUCED BY THE TOUCHES WITH WHICH HE HAD ALREADY WORKED US UP
121-127105-0026 THE FIRST OF THESE TOUCHES CONVEYED THAT THE WRITTEN STATEMENT TOOK UP THE TAIL AT A POINT AFTER IT HAD IN A MANNER FORGUN
121-127105-0027 HE HAD FOR HIS OWN TOWN RESIDENCE OF BIG HOUSE FILLED WITH THE SPOILS OF TRAVEL AND THE TROPHIES OF THE CHASE BUT IT WAS TO HIS COUNTRY HOME AN OLD FAMILY PLACE IN ESSEX THAT HE WISHED HER IMMEDIATELY TO PROCEED

121-127105-0036 BUT WAS THAT ALL HER REVWARD ONE OF THE LADIES ASK
1221-135766-0000 HOW STRANGE IT SEEMED TO THE SAD WOMAN AS SHE WATCHED THE GROWTH AND THE BEAUTY THAT BECAME EVERY DAY MORE BRILLIANT AND THE INTELLIGENCE THAT THROUGH ITS QUIVERING SUNSHINE OVER THE TINY FEATURES OF THIS CHILD
1221-135766-0001 GOD AS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE SIN WHICH MAN THUS PUNISHED HAD GIVEN HER A LOVELY CHILD WHOSE PLACE WAS ON THAT SAME DISHONORED BOSOM TO CONNECT HER PARENT FOREVER WITH THE RACE AND DESCENT OF MORTALS AND TO BE FINALLY OFLESS SOUL IN HEAVEN
1221-135766-0002 YET THESE THOUGHTS AFFECTEDS TO PRIN LESS WITH HOPE THAN APPREHENSION
1221-135766-0003 THE CHILD HAD A NATIVE GRACE WHICH DOES NOT INVARIABLY CO EXIST WITH FAULTLESS BEAUTY ITS TIRE HOWEVER SIMPLE ALWAYS IMPRESSED THE BEHOLDER AS IF IT WERE THE VERY GARB THAT PRECISELY BECAME IT BEST
1221-135766-0004 THIS OUTWARD MUUTABILITY INDICATED AND DID NOT MORE THAN FAIRLY EXPRESS THE VARIOUS PROPERTIES OF HER INNER LIFE
1221-135766-0005 HESOR COULD ONLY ACCOUNT FOR THE CHILD'S CHARACTER AND EVEN THEN MOST VAGUELY AND IMPERFECTLY BY RECALLING WHAT SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN DURING THAT MOMENTOUS PERIOD WHILE PEARL WAS AMBIBING HER SOUL FROM THE SPIRITUAL WORLD AND HER BODILY FRAM FROM ITS MATERIAL OF EARTH
1221-135766-0006 THEY WERE NOW ILLUMINATED BY THE MORNING RADIANCE OF A YOUNG CHILD'S DISPOSITION BUT LATER IN THE DAY OF EARTHLY EXISTENCE MIGHT BE PRELIFIC OF THE STORM AND WHIRLWIND
1221-135766-0007 HESTER PRIN NEVERTHELESS THE LOVING MOTHER OF THIS ONE CHILD RAN LITTLE RISK OF AIRRING ON THE SIDE OF UNDUCEEVERITY
1221-135766-0008 MINDFUL HOWEVER OF HER OWN ERRORS AND MISFORTUNES SHE EARLY SOUGHT TO IMPOSE A TENDER BUT STRICT CONTROL OVER THE INFANT IMMORTALITY THAT WAS COMMITTED TO HER CHARGE
1221-135766-0009 AS TO ANY OTHER KIND OF DISCIPLINE WHETHER ADDRESSED TO HER MIND OR HEART LITTLE PEARL MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE WITHIN ITS REACH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CAPRIECE THAT ROLLED THE MOMENT
1221-135766-0010 IT WAS A LOOK SO INTELLIGENT ET ITEXPLICABLE PERVERSE SOMETIMES SO MALICIOUS BUT GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED BY A WILD FLOW OF SPIRITS THAT HESOR COULD NOT HAVE QUESTIONING AT SUCH MOMENTS WITHTHER PEARL WAS A HUMAN CHILD
1221-135766-0011 BEHOLDING IT ESTHER WAS CONSTRAINED TO RUSH TOWARDS THE CHILD TO PURSUE THE LITTLE EALTH IN THE FLIGHT WHICH SHE INVARIABLY BEGAN TO SNATCH HER TO HER BOSOM WITH A CLOSE PRESSURE AND EARNEST KISSES NOT SO MUCH FROM OVERFLOWING LOVE AS TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT PEARL WAS FLESH AND BLOOD AND NOT UTTERLY DELUSIVE
1221-135766-0012 BROODING OVER ALL THESE MATTERS THE MOTHER FELT LIKE ONE WHO HAS A VOKE TO SPIRIT BUT BY SOME IRREGULARITY IN THE PROCESS OF CONJURATION HAS FAILED TO WIN THE MASTER WORD THAT SHOULD CONTROL THIS NEW AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE INTELLIGENCE
1221-135766-0013 PEARL WAS A BORNE OUTCAST OF THE INFANTILE WORLD
1221-135766-0014 PEARL SAW AND GAZED INTENTLY BUT NEVER SOUGHT TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE
1221-135766-0015 IF SPOKEN TO SHE WOULD NOT SPEAK AGAIN
1221-135767-0000 HESTER PRINT WENT ONE DAY TO THE MANSION OF GOVERNOR BELLING HIM WITH A PAIR OF GLOVES WHICH SHE HAD FRINGED AND EMBROIDERED TO HIS ORDER AND WHICH WERE TO BE WORN ON SOME GREAT OCCASION OF STATE BORE THOUGH THE CHANCES OF A POPULAR ELECTION HAD CAUSED THE FORMER RULER TO DESCEND A STEP OR TWO FROM THE HIGHESTRANK HE STILL HELD AN HONORABLE AND INFLUENTIAL PLACE AMONG THE COLONIAL MAGISTRCY
1221-135767-0001 ANOTHER AND FAR MORE IMPORTANT REASON THAN THE DELIVERY OF A PAIR OF EMBROIDERED GLOVES IMPELLED HESOR AT THIS TIME TO SEEK AN INTERVIEW WITH A PERSONAGE OF SO MUCH POWER AND ACTIVITY IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE SETTLEMENT
1221-135767-0002 AT THAT EPOCH OF PRISTINE SIMPLICITY HOWEVER MATTERS OF EVEN SLTER PUBLIC INTEREST AND A FAR LESS AND TRINSIC WEATE THAN THE WELFARE OF HESTER AND HER CHILD WERE STRANGELY MIXED UP WITH THE DELIBERATIONS OF LEGISLATORS AND ACTS OF STATE
1221-135767-0003 THE PERIOD WAS HARDLY IF AT ALL EARLIER THAN THAT OF OUR STORY WHEN A DISPUTE CONCERNING THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY IN A PIG NOT ONLY CAUSE A FIERCE AND BITTER CONTEST IN THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OF THE COLONY BUT RESULTED IN AN IMPORTANT MODIFICATION OF THE FRAMEW WORK ITSELF OF THE LEGISLATURE
1221-135767-0004 WE HAVE SPOKEN OF PEARLS RICH AND LUXUORRIIANT BEAUTY A BEAUTY THAT SHONE WITH DEEP AND VIVID TINTS A BRIGHT COMPLEXION EYES POSSESSING INTENSITY BOTH OF DEPTH AND GLOW AND HARE ALREADY OF A DEEP GLOSSY BROWN AND WHICH IN AFTER YEARS WOULD BE NEARLY AKIN TO BLACK
1221-135767-0005 IT WAS THE SCARLET LETTER IN ANOTHER FORM THE SCARLET LETTER ENDOWED WITH LIFE
1221-135767-0006 THE MOTHER HERSELF AS IF THE RED IGNOMINY WERE SO DEEPLY SCORCHED INTO HER BRAIN THAT ALL HER CONCEPTIONS ASSUMED ITS FORM HAD CAREFULLY WROUGHT OUT THE SIMILITUDE LAVISHING MANY HOURS OF MORBID INGENUITY TO CREATE AN ANLOGY BETWEEN THE OBJECT OF HER AFFECTION AND THE EMBLEM OF HER GUILT AND TORTURE
1221-135767-0007 BUT IN TRUTH PEARL WAS THE ONE AS WELL AS THE OTHER AND ONLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IDENTITY HAD HES HER CONTRIVE SO PERFECTLY TO REPRESENT THE SCARLET LETTER IN HER APPEARANCE
1221-135767-0008 COME THEREFORE AND LET US FLING MUT AT THEM
1221-135767-0009 BUT PEARL WHO WAS A DAUNTLESS CHILD AFTER FROWNING STAMPING HER FOOT AND SHAKING HER LITTLE HAND WITH A VARIETY OF THREATENING GESTURES SUDDENLY MADE A RUSH AT THE KNOT OF HER ENEMIES AND PUT THEM ALL TO FLIGHT
1221-135767-0010 SHE SCREAMED AND SHOUTED TOO WITH A TERRIFIC VOLUME OF SOUND WHICH DOUBTLESS CAUSE THE HEARTS OF THE FUGITIVES TO QUAKE WITHIN THEM
1221-135767-0011 IT WAS FURTHER DECORATED WITH STRANGE AND SEEMINGLY CAVALISTIC FIGURES AND DIAGRAMS SUITABLE TO THE QUINT TASTE OF THE AGE WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN IN THE STCCO WHEN NEWLY LAID ON AND HAD NOW GROWN HARD AND DORABLE FOR THE ADMIRATION OF AFTER TIMES
1221-135767-0012 THEY APPROACHED THE DOOR WHICH WAS OF AN ARCHED FORM AND FLANKED ON EACH SIDE BY A NARROW TOWER OR PROJECTION OF THE EDIFICE IN BOTH OF WHICH WERE LATDICEED WINDOWS THE WOODEN SHUTTERS TO CLOSE OVER THEM AT NEED
1221-135767-0013 LIFTING THE IRON HAMMER THAT HUNG AT THE PORTALSTER PRIN GAVE A SUMMONS WHICH WAS ANSWERED BY ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BOND SERVANTS A FREE BORN ENGLISH MAN BUT NOW A SEVEN YEARS SLAVE
1221-135767-0014 YE HIS HONORABLE WORSHIP ISB WITHIN BUT HE HATH A GODLY MINISTER OR TO WITH HIM AND LIKEWISE A LEACH
1221-135767-0015 YE MAY NOT SEE HIS WORSHIP NOW
1221-135767-0016 WITH MANY VARIATIONS SUGGESTED BY THE NATURE OF HIS BUILDING MATERIALS DIVERSITY OF CLIMATE AND A DIFFERENT MODE OF SOCIAL LIFE GOVERNOR BELLING HIM HAD PLANNED HIS NEW HABITATION AFTER THE RESIDENCES OF GENTLEMEN OF FAIRE STATE IN HIS NATIVE LAND
1221-135767-0017 ON THE TABLE AND TOKENED THAT THE SENTIMENT OF OLD ENGLISH HOSPITALITY HAD NOT BEEN LEFT BEHIND STOOD A LARGE PEUTER TANKERD AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH HAD HESTER OR PEARL PEEPED INTO IT THEY MIGHT HAVE SEEN THE FROTHY REMNANT OF A RECENT DRAFT OF ALE
1221-135767-0018 LITTLE PEARL WHO WAS AS GREATLY PLEASED WITH THE GLEAMING ARMOUR AS SHE HAD BEEN WITH THE GLITTERING FRONTAS PIECE OF THE HOUSE SPENT SOME TIME LOOKING INTO THE POLISHED MIRROR OF THE BREAST PLATE
1221-135767-0019 MOTHER CRIED SHE I SEE YOU HERE LOOK LOOK
1221-135767-0020 AND TRUTH SHE SEEMED ABSOLUTELY HIDDEN BEHIND IT
1221-135767-0021 PEARL ACCORDINGLY RAN TO THE BEOW WINDOW AT THE FURTHER END OF THE HALL AND LOOKED ALONG THE VISTA OF A GARDEN WALK CARPETED WITH CLOSELY SHAVEN GRASS AND BORDERED WITH SOME RUDE AND IMMATOR ATTEMPT AT SHRUBBERY
1221-135767-0022 BUT THE PROPRIETOR APPEARED ALREADY TO HAVE EVERY LINGQUISHED AS HOPELESS THE EFFORT TO PERPETUATE ON THIS SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC IN A HARD SOIL AND AMID THE CLOSE STRUGGLE FOR SUBSISTENCE THE NATIVE ENGLISH TASTE FOR ORNAMENTAL GARDENING
1221-135767-0023 THERE WERE A FEW ROSE BUSHES HOWEVER AND A NUMBER OF APPLE TREES PROBABLY THE DESCENDANTENCE OF THOSE PLANTED BY THE REVERD MISTER BLACKSTONE THE FIRST SETTLER OF THE PENINSULA THAT HALF MI METHOLOGICAL PERSONAGE WHO RIDES THROUGH ARE EARLY ANIMALS SEATED ON THE BACK OF THE BULL
1221-135767-0024 PEARL SEEING THE ROSE BUSHES BEGAN TO CRY FOR A RED ROSE AND WOULD NOT BE PASSIFIED
1284-1180-0000 HE WORE BLUE SILK STOCKINGS BLOEONY PANTS WITH GOLD BUCKLES A BLUE RUFFLED WAISTE AND A JACKET OF BRIGHT BLUE BRTED WITH GOLD
1284-1180-0001 HIS HAT HAD A PEAKED CROWNED A FLAT BRIM AND AROUND THE BRIM WAS A ROW OF TINY GOLDEN BELLS THAT TINKLED WHEN HE MOVED
1284-1180-0002 INSTEAD OF SHOES THE OLD MAN WORE BOOTS WITH TURN OVER TOPS AND HIS BLUE COAT HAD WIDE CUFFS OF GOLD BRAID
1284-1180-0003 FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD WISHED TO EXPLORE THE BEAUTIFULLAND OFWASE IN WHICH THEY LIVED
1284-1180-0004 WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE UNSIMPLY LATCHED THE DOOR AND STARTED UP THE PATH
1284-1180-0005 NO ONE WOULD DISTURB THEIR LITTLE HOUSE EVEN IF ANY ONE CAME SO FAR INTO THE THICK FOREST WHILE THEY WERE GONE
1284-1180-0006 AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT SEPARATED THE COUNTRY OF THE MUNCHKINS FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE GLLICONS THE PATH DIVIDED
1284-1180-0007 HE KNEW IT WOULD TAKE THEM TO THE HOUSE OF THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN BUT WHO WAS THEIR NEAREST NEIGHBOR
1284-1180-0008 ALL THE MORNING THEY TRUDGED UP THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND IT NOON UNC AND OJO SAT ON A FALLEN TREE TRUNK AND AT THE LAST OF THE BREAD WHICH THE OLD LUNCHKIN HAD PLACED IN HIS POCKET
1284-1180-0009 THEN THEY STARTED ON AGAIN AND TWO HOURS LATER CAME IN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE OF DOCTOR PIPP
1284-1180-0010 HU UNC KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE AND A CHUBBY PLEASANT FACED WOMAN DRESSED ALL AND BLUE OPENED IT AND GREETED THE VISITORS WITH A SMILE
1284-1180-0011 I AM MY DEAR AND ALL STRANGERS ARE WELCOME TO MY HOME
1284-1180-0012 WE HAVE COME FROM A FIR LONELY A PLACE THAN THIS A LONELIER PLACE
1284-1180-0013 AND YOU MUST BE O JOOV THEIANLUCKY SHE ADDED
1284-1180-0014 OHDO HAD NEVER EATEN SUCH A FINE MEAL AND ALL HIS LIFE
1284-1180-0015 WE ARE TRAVELING REPLIED O JO AND LEAST STOP THAT YOUR HOUSE JUST A RERESS AND REFRESH OURSELVES
1284-1180-0016 THE WOMAN SEEMED THOUGHTFUL
1284-1180-0017 AT ONE END STOOD A GREAT FIREPLACE IN WHICH A BLUE LOG WAS BLAZING WITH A BLUE FLAME AND OVER THE FIRE HUNG FOR HEETTLES IN A ROW ALL BUBBLING AND STEAMING AT A GREAT RATE
1284-1180-0018 IT TAKES ME SEVERAL YEARS TO MAKE THIS MAGIC POWDER BUT AT THIS MOMENT I AM PLEAASED TO SAY IT IS NEARLY DONE YOU SEE I AM MAKING IT FOR MY GOOD WIFE MARGALLT WHO WANTS TO SOME OF IT FOR A PURPOSE OF HER OWN
1284-1180-0019 YOU MUST KNOW SAID MARGAETLLT WHEN THEY WERE ALL SEATED TOGETHER ON THE BROAD WINDOW SEAT THAT MY HUSBAND FOOLISHLY GAVE AWAY ALL THE POWDER OF LIFE HE FIRST MADE TO OLD MAN BE THE WITCH WHO USED TO LEAVE IN THE COUNTRY OF THE GLLICANS TO THE NORTHTH HERE
1284-1180-0020 THE FIRST LOT WE TESTED ON OUR GLASS CA HAT WHICH NOT ONLY BEGAN TO LIVE BUT HAS LIVED EVER SINCE
1284-1180-0021 I THINK THE NEXT GLASS CAP A MAGICIAN MAKES WILL HAVE NEITHER BRAINS NOR HEART FOR THEN IT WILL NOT OBJECT TO CATCHING MICE AND THEY PROVE OF SOME USED TO US
1284-1180-0022 I'M AFRAID I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE LAND OF US
1284-1180-0023 YOU SEE I'VE LIVED ALL MY LIFE WITHOUT NONKEY THE SILENT ONE AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO TELL ME ANYTHING
1284-1180-0024 THAT IS ONE REASON YOUOR OJO THE UNLUCKY SAID THE WOMAN IN SYMPATHETIC TONE
1284-1180-0025 I THINK I MUST SHOW YOU MY PATCHORT GIRL SAID MARGALLT LAUGHING AT THE BOY'S ASTONISHMENT FOR SHE IS RATHER DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN
1284-1180-0026 BUT FIRST I WILL TELL YOU THAT FROM MANY YEARS I HAVE LONGED FOR A SERVANT TO HELP ME WITH THE HOUSE WORK AND TO COPE THE MEALS AND WASH THE DISHES
1284-1180-0027 YET THAT TASK WAS NOT SO EASY AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE
1284-1180-0028 A BED QUIILT MADE OF PATCHES OF DIFFERENT KINDS AND COLLURS OF CLOTH ONLYATLY SO TOGETHER
1284-1180-0029 SOMETIMES IT IS CALLED A CRAZY QUIILT BECAUSE THE PATCHES AND COLOURS ARE SO MICKXED UP
1284-1180-0030 WHEN I FOUND IT I SAID TO MYSELF THAT IT WOULD DO NICELY FOR MY SERVANT GIRL FOR WHEN SHE WAS BROUGHT TO LIFE SHE WOULD NOT BE PROUD NOR HAUGHTY AS THE GLASS CAT IS FOR SUCH A DREADFUL MIXTURE OF COLORS WOULD DISCOURD HER FROM TIME TO BE AS DIGNIFIED AS THE BLUE MUNCHKINS ARE
1284-1180-0031 AT THE EMERALD CITY WHERE OUR PRINCESS OSM MA LIVES GREEN IS THE POPULAR COLOR
1284-1180-0032 I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT A GOOD JOWB I DID AND SHE WENT TO A TALL CUPBOARD AND THREW OP IN THE DOORS
1284-1181-0000 OH YOU EXAMINED THIS CURIOUS CONTRIVANCE WITH WONDER
1284-1181-0001 MARGALLLAD HAD FIRST MADE THE GIRLS FORM FROM THE PATCHWART QUIILED AND THEN SHE HAD DRESSED IT WITH A PATCHWORK SKIRT AND AN APRON WITH POCKETS IN IT USING THE SAME GAMYE MATERIAL THROUGHOU OUT
1284-1181-0002 THE HEAD OF THE PATCHWART GIRL WAS THE MOST CURIOUS PART OF HER
1284-1181-0003 THE HAIR WAS OF BROWN YARN AND HUNG DOWN ON HER NECK IN SEVERAL NEAT BRAIDS
1284-1181-0004 GOLD IS THE MOST COMMON METAL IN THE LAND OF AWS AND IS USED FOR MAN PURPOSES BECAUSE IT IS SOFT IMPLIABLE
1284-1181-0005 NO I FORGOT ON ABOUT THE BRAINS EXCLAIMED THE WOMAN
1284-1181-0006 WELL THAT MAY BE TRUE AGREED MARGELT BUT ON THE CONTRARY A SERVANT WITH TOO MUCH BRAINS IS SURE TO BECOME INDEPENDENT IN HIGH AND MIGHTY AND FEEL ABOVE HER WORK
1284-1181-0007 SHE POURED INTO THE DISHA QUANTITY FROM EACH OF THESE BOTTLES
1284-1181-0008 I THINK THAT WILL DO SHE CONTINUED FOR THE OTHER QUALITIES ARE NOT NEEDED IN A SERVANT
1284-1181-0009 SHE RAN TO HER HUSBAND SIDE AT ONCE AND HELPED HIM LIFT THE FOEUR CAETTELS FROM THE FIRE
1284-1181-0010 THEIR CONTENTS HAD WHO BOILED AWAY LEAVING IN THE BOTTOM OF EACH KTTLE A FEW GRAINS OF FINE WHITE POWDER
1284-1181-0011 VERY CAREFULLY THE MAGICIAN REMOVED THIS POWDER PLACING IT ALTOGETHER IN A GOLDEN DISH WHERE HE MIXED IT WITH A GOLDEN SPOON
1284-1181-0012 NO ONE SAW HIM DO THIS FOR ALL WERE LOOKING AT THE POWDER OF LIFE BUT SOON THE WOMAN REMEMBERED WHAT SHE HAD BEEN DOING AND CAME BACK TO THE CUPBOARD
1284-1181-0013 OHDO BECAME A BIT UNEASY AT THIS FOR HE HAD ALREADY PUT QUITE A LOT OF THE CLEVERNESS POWDER IN THE DISH BUT HE DARED NOT INTERFERE AND SO HE COMFORTED HIMSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT ONE CANNOT HAVE TOO MUCH CLEVERNESS
1284-1181-0014 HE SELECTED A SMALL GOLD BOTTLE WITH A PEPPER BOX TOP SO THAT THE POWDER MIGHT BE SPRINKLED ON ANY OBJECT THROUGH THE SMALL HOLES
1284-1181-0015 MOST PEOPLE TALKED TOO MUCH SO IT IS A RELIEF TO FIND ONE WHO TALKS TOO LITTLE
1284-1181-0016 I AM NOT ALLOWED BEFORE MAGIC EXCEPT FOR MY OWN AMUSEMENT HE TOLD HIS VISITORS AS HE LIGHTED A PIPE WHERE THE CRAKED STEM AND BEGAN TO SMOKE
1284-1181-0017 THE WORSIT OFS WHO USED TO BE A HUMBUGAN KNEW NO MAGIC AT ALL HAS BEEN TAKING LESSONS OF GLENDA AND I'M TOLD HE IS GETTING TO BE A PRETTY GOOD WIZARD BUT HE IS MERELY THE ASSISTANT OF THE GREAT SOURCE ORS
1284-1181-0018 IT TRULY IS ASSERTED THE MAGICIAN
1284-1181-0019 I NOW USE THEM AS ORNAMENTAL STATEUARY IN MY GARDEN
1284-1181-0020 DEAR ME WHAT A CHATTER BOX ARE GETTING TO BE UNK REMARKED THE MAGICIAN WHO WAS PLEASED WITH THE COMPLIMENT
1284-1181-0021 ASKED THE VOICE IN SCORNFUL ACCENTS
1284-134647-0000 THE GRATEFUL APPLAUSE OF THE CLERGY HAS CONSECRATED THE MEMORY OF A PRINCE WHO INDULGEED THEIR PASSIONS AND PROMOTED THEIR INTEREST
1284-134647-0001 THE EDICT OF MELAN THE GREAT CHARTER OF TOLERATION HAD CONFIRM TO EACH INDIVIDUAL OF THE ROMAN WORLD THE PRIVILEGE OF CHOOSING AND PROFESSING HIS OWN RELIGION
1284-134647-0002 BUT THIS INESTIMABLE PRIVILEGE WAS SOON VIOLATED WITH THE A KNOWLEDGE OF TRUTH THE EMPERORBIBED THE MAXIMS OF PERSECUTION AND THE SEX WHICH DESCENTED FROM THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WERE AFFLICTED AND OPPRESSED BY THE TRIUMPH OF CHRISTIANITY
1284-134647-0003 CONSTANTINE EASILY BELIEVED THAT THE HERETICS WHO PRESUMED TO DISPUTE HIS OPINIONS OR TO OPPOSE HIS COMMANDS WERE GUILTY OF THE MOST ABSURD AND CRIMINAL OBSTINACY AND THAT A SEASONABLE APPLICATION OF MODERATE SEVERITIES MIGHT SAVE THOSE UNHAPPY MEN FROM THE DANGER OF AN EVERLASTING CONDENATION
1284-134647-0004 SOME OF THE PENAL REGULATIONS WERE COPIED FROM THE EEDICTS OF DICLTION AND THIS METHOD OF CONVERSION WAS APPLADTED BY THE SAME BISHOPS WHO HAD FELT THE HAND OF OPPRESSION AND PLEADED FOR THE RIGHTS OF HUMANITY
1284-134647-0005 THEY ASSERTED WITH CONFIDENCE AND ALMOST WITH EXALTATION THAT THE OPPOSTOLICAL SUCCESSION WAS INTERRUPTED THAT ALL THE BISHOPS OF EUROPE AND ASIA WERE INFFECTED BY THE KTAGION OF GUILT AND SKISM AND THAT THE PREROGATIVE OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WERE CONFINED TO THE CHOSEN PORTION OF THE AFRICAN BELIEVERS WHO ALONE HAD PRESERVED IN VIOLET THE INTEGRITY OF THEIR FAITH AND DISCIPLINE
1284-134647-0006 BISHOPS VIRGINS AND EVEN SPOTLESS INFANTS WERE SUBJECTED TO THE DISGRACE OF A PUBLIC PENS BEFORE THEY COULD BE ADMITTED TO THE COMMUNION OF THE DOONATISTS
1284-134647-0007 PRESCRIBED BY THE CIVIL AND ECCLESIASTICAL POWERS OF THE EMPIRE THE DONATTIST STILL MAINTAINED IN SOME PROVINCES PARTICULARLY IN AMIDA THEIR SUPERIOR NUMBERS AND FOUR HUNDRED BISHOPS ACKNOWLEDGE THE JURISDICTION OF THEIR PRIMATE
1320-122612-0000 SINCE THE PERIOD OF OUR TALE THE ACT OF SPIRIT OF THE COUNTRY HAS SURROUNDED IT WITH A BELT OF RICH AND THRIVING SETTLEMENTS THOUGH NONE BUT THE HUNTER OR THE SAVAGES EVER KNOWN EVEN NOW TO PENETRAT ITS WILD RECESSES
1320-122612-0001 THE DEWS WERE SUFFERED TO EX HAIL AND THE SUN HAD DISPERSED THE MISTS AND WAS SHETTING A STRONG AND CLEAR LIGHT IN THE FOREST WHEN THE TRAVELLERS RESUMED THEIR JOURNEY
1320-122612-0002 AFTER PROCEEDING A FEW MILES THE PROGRESS OF HAWK EYE WHO LED THE ADVANCE BECAME MORE DELIBERATE AND WATCHFUL
1320-122612-0003 HE OFTEN STOPPED TO EXAMINE THE TREES NOR DID HE CROSSED A RIVULATE WITHOUT ATENTIVELY CONSIDERING THE QUANTITY THE VELOCITY AND THE COLOR OF ITS WATERS
1320-122612-0004 DISTRUSTING HIS OWN JUDGMENT HIS APPEALS TO THE OPINION OF CHINGKUATCH GOOK WERE FREQUENT AND EARNEST
1320-122612-0005 YET HERE ARE WE WITHIN A SHORT RANGE OF THE SCEROONS AND NOT A SIGN OF A TRAIL HAVE WE CROSSED
1320-122612-0006 LET US RETRACE OUR STEPS AND EXAMINE AS WE GO WITH KEEN OR EYES
1320-122612-0007 CHING GUTCH GOOK HAD CAUGHT THE LOOK AND MOTIONING WITH HIS HAND HE BADE HIM SPEAK
1320-122612-0008 THE EYES OF THE WHOLE PARTY FOLLOWED THE UNEXPECTED MOVEMENT AND READ THEIR SUCCESS IN THE AIR OF TRIUMPH THAT THE YOUTH ASSUMED
1320-122612-0009 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE WONDERFUL HAD HE SPOKEN WITHOUT A BIDDING
1320-122612-0010 SEE SAID UNCAS POINTING NORTH AND SOUTH AT THE EVIDENT MARKS OF THE BROAD TRAIL ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM THE DARK HAIR HAS GONE TOWARD THE FOREST
1320-122612-0011 IF A ROCK OR RIVELEET OR BIT OF EARTH HARDER THAN COMMON SEVERED THE LINKS OF THE CLEW THEY FOLLOWED THE TRUE E IYE OF THE SCOUT RECOVERED THEM AT A DISTANCE AND SELDOM RENDERED THE DELAY OF A SINGLE MOMENT NECESSARY
1320-122612-0012 EXTINGUISHED BRANDS WERE LYING AROUND A SPRING THE AWFULS OF A DEAR WERE SCATTERED ABOUT THE PLACE AND THE TREES WERE EVIDENT MARKS OF HAVING BEEN BROWSED BY THE HORSES
1320-122612-0013 A CIRCLE OF A FEW HUNDRED FEET IN CIRCUMFERENCE WAS DRAWN AND EACH OF THE PARTY TOOK A SEGNMENT FOR HIS PORTION
1320-122612-0014 THE EXAMINATION HOWEVER RESULTED IN NOT DISCOVERY
1320-122612-0015 THE WHOLE PARTY CROWDED TO THE SPOT WERE UNCAS POINTED OUT THE IMPRESSION OF A MOCCASIN IN THE MOISTLOUVIION
1320-122612-0016 RUN BACK UNCAS AND BRING ME THE SIZE OF THE SINGER'S FOOT
1320-122617-0000 NOTWITHSTANDING THE HIGH RESOLUTION OF HAWK EYE HE FULLY COMPREHENDED ALL THE DIFFICULTIES AND DANGER HE WAS ABOUT TO INCUR
1320-122617-0001 IN HIS RETURN TO THE CAMP HIS AECUTE HIM PRACTISED INTELLECTS WERE INTENTLY ENGAGED IN DEVISING MEANS TO COUNTERACT A WATCHFULNESS AND SUSPICION ON THE PART OF HIS ENEMIES THAT HE KNEW WERE IN NO DEGREE INFERIOR TO HIS OWN
1320-122617-0002 IN OTHER WORDS WHILE HE HAD IMPLICIT FAITH IN THE ABILITY OF BAILAMS AS TO SPEAK HE WAS SOMEWHAT SKPTACLE ON THE SUBJECT OF A BAAR'S SINGING AND YET HE HAD BEEN ASSURED OF THE LATTER ON THE TESTIMONY OF HIS OWN EXQUISITE ORGANS
1320-122617-0003 THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS AIR AND THE MANNER THAT BETRAYED TO THE SCOUT THE UTTER CONFUSION OF THE STATE OF HIS MIND
1320-122617-0004 THE INGENIOUS HAWK EY WHO RECALLED THE HASTY MANNER IN WHICH THE OTHER HAD ABANDONED HIS POST AT THE BEDSIDE OF THE SICK WOMAN WAS NOT WITHOUT HIS SUSPICIONS CONCERNING THE SUBJECT OF SO MUCH SOLEMN DELIBERATION
1320-122617-0005 THE BAARS SHOOK HIS SHAGGY SIDES AND THEN A WELL KNOWN VOICE REPLIED
1320-122617-0006 CAN THESE THINGS BE RETURNED DAVID BREATHING MORE FREELY AS THE TRUTH BEGAN TO DAWN UPON HIM
1320-122617-0007 COME COME RETURNED HAWKY UNCASING HIS HONEST COUNTENANCE THE BETTER TO ASSURE THE WAVERING CONFIDENCE OF HIS COMPANION YOU MAY SEE A SKIN WHICH IF IT BE NOT AS WHITE AS ONE OF THE GENTLE ONES HAS NO TINGE OF RED TO IT THAT THE WINDS OF THE HEAVEN IN THE SUN HAVE NOT BESTOWED NOW LET US TO BUSINESS
1320-122617-0008 THE YOUNG MAN IS EBNDAGE AND MUCH I FEAR HIS DEATH IS DECREED
1320-122617-0009 I GREATLY MOURN THAT ONE SO WELL DISPOSED SHOULD DIE IN HIS IGNORANCE AND I HAVE SOUGHT A GOODLY HIM CAN YOU LEAD ME TO HIM
1320-122617-0010 THE TASK WILL NOT BE DIFFICULT RETURN DAVID HESITATING THOUGH I GREATLY FERIOR PRESENCE WOULD RATHER INCREASE THAT MITIGATE IS UNHAPPY FORTUNES
1320-122617-0011 THE LODGGE IN WHICH UNCAS WAS CONFINED WAS IN THE VERY CENTRE OF THE VILLAGE AND IN A SITUATION PERHAPS MORE DIFFICULT THAN ANY OTHER TO APPROACH OR LEAVE WITHOUT OBSERVATION
1320-122617-0012 FOUR A FIVE OF THE LATTER ONLY LINGERED ABOUT THE DOOR OF THE PRISON OF UNCAS WEARY BUT CLOSE OBSERVERS OF THE MANNER OF THEIR CAPTIVE
1320-122617-0013 DELIVERED IN A STRONG TONE OF ASSENT ANNOUNCED THE GRATIFICATION THE SAVAGE WOULD RECEIVE IN WITNESSING SUCH AN EXHIBITION OF WEAKNESS AND AN ENEMY SO LONG HATED AND SO MUCH FEARED
1320-122617-0014 THEY DREW BACK A LITTLE FROM THE ENTRANCE AND MOTION TO THE SUPPOSE IT CONJUR TO ENTER
1320-122617-0015 BUT THE BARE INSTEAD OF A BAYING MAINTAIN THE SEAT IT HAD TAKEN AND GROWLED
1320-122617-0016 THE CUNNING MAN IS AFRAID THAT HIS BREATH WILL BLOW UPON HIS BROTHERS AND TAKE AWAY THEIR COURAGE TOO CONTINUED DAVID IMPROVING THE HIN HE RECEIVED THEY MUST STAND FURTHER OFF
1320-122617-0017 THEN AS IF SATISFIED OF THEIR SAFETY THE SCOUT LEFT HIS POSITION AND SLOWLY ENTERED THE PLACE
1320-122617-0018 IT WAS SILENT AND GLOOMY BEING TENANTED SOLELY BY THE CAPTIVE ENLIGHTED BY THE DYING EMBERS OF A FIRE WHICH HAD BEEN USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF COOKERY
1320-122617-0019 LANCAS OCCUPIED A DISTANT CORNER IN A RECLINING ATTITUDE BEING RIGIDLY BOUND BOTH HANDS AND FEET BY STRONG AND PAINFUL WITHS
1320-122617-0020 THE SCOUT WHO HAD LEFT DAVID AT THE DOOR TO ASCERTAIN THEY WERE NOT OBSERVED THOUGHT IT PRUDENT TO PRESERVE HIS DISGUISE UNTIL ASSURED OF THEIR PRIVACY
1320-122617-0021 WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH THE MINGOWS AT THE DOOR THEY COUNT SIX AND THE SINGERERS AS GOOD AS NOTHING
1320-122617-0022 THE DELAWARES ARE CHILDREN OF THE TORTOISE AND THEY OUTSRIPPED THE DEER
1320-122617-0023 UNCAS WHO HAD ALREADY APPROACHED THE DOOR AND READINESS TO LEAD THE WAY NOW RECOILED AND PLACED HIMSELF ONCE MORE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE LODGE
1320-122617-0024 BUT HACKY WHO WAS TOO MUCH OCCUPIED WITH HIS OWN THOUGHTS TO NOTE THE MOVEMENT CONTINUED SPEAKING MORE TO HIMSELF INTO HIS COMPANION
1320-122617-0025 SO UNCUS YOU HADD BETTER TAKE THE LEAD WHILE I WILL PUT ON THE SKIN AGAIN AND TRUST TO CUNNING FOR WANT OF SPEED
1320-122617-0026 WELL WHAT CAN'T BE DONE BY MAIN COURAGE IN WAR MUST BE DONE BY CIRCUMVENTION
1320-122617-0027 AS SOON AS THESE DISPOSITIONS WERE MADE THE SCOUT TURN TO DAVID AND GAVE HIM HIS PARTY INSTRUCTIONS
1320-122617-0028 MY PURSUITS ARE PEACEFUL AND MY TEMPER I HUMBLY TRUST IS GREATLY GIVEN TO MERCY IN LOVE RETURNED DAVID A LITTLE NETHOLD THAT SO DIRECT AN ATTACK ON HIS MANHOOD BUT THERE ARE NONE WHO CAN SAY THAT I HAVE EVER FORGOTEN MY FAITH IN THE LORD EVEN IN THE GREATEST STRAITIGHTS
1320-122617-0029 IF YOU ARE NOT THEN KNOCKED ON THE HEAD YOUR BEING AN NONCOMPOSSOR WILL PROTECT YOU AND YOU THEN HAVE A GOOD REASON TO EXPECT TO DIE IN YOUR BED
1320-122617-0030 SU CHOOSE FOR YOURSELF TO MAKE A RUSH ORTERARY HERE
1320-122617-0031 BRAVELY IN GENEROUSLY AS HE BATTLED IN MY BEHALF AND THIS AND MORE WILL I DARE IN HIS SERVICE
1320-122617-0032 KEEP SILENT AS LONG AS MAY BE AND IT WOULD BE WISE WHEN YOU DO SPEAK TO BREAK OUT SUDDENLY IN ONE OF YOUR SHOUTINGS WHICH WILL SERVE TO REMIND THE INDIANS THAT YOU ARE NOT ALTOGETHER AS RESPONSIBLE AS MEN SHOULD BE
1320-122617-0033 IF HOWEVER THEY TAKE YOUR SCALP AS I TRUST AND BELIEVE THEY WILL NOT DEPEND ON IT UNCAS AND I WILL NOT FORGET THE DEED BUT REVENGE IT IS BECOMES TRUE WARRIORS IN TRUSTY FRIENDS

1320-122617-0035 THEN HEAVING A HEAVY SIGH PROBABLY AMONG THE LAST HE EVER DREW IN PINING FOR A CONDITION HE HAD SO LONG ABANDONED HE ADDED IT IS WHAT I WOULD WISH TO PRACTISE MYSELF AS ONE WITHOUT ACROSS A BLOOD THOUGH IT IS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO DEAL WITH AN INDIAN AS YOU WOULD WITH A FELLOW CHRISTIAN
1320-122617-0036 GOD BLESS YOU FRIEND I DO BELIEVE YOUR SENT HAS NOT GREATLY WRONG WHEN THE MATTER IS DULY CONSIDERED AND KEEPING ETERNITY BEFORE THE EYES THOUGH MUCH DEPENDS ON THE NATURAL GIFTS AND THE FORCE OF TEMPTATION
1320-122617-0037 THE DELAWARE DOG HE SAID LEANING FORWARD AND PEERING THROUGH THE DIM LIGHT TO CATCH THE EXPRESSION OF THE OTHER'S FEATURES IS HE AFRAID
1320-122617-0038 WILL THE HERANES HEAR HIS GROANS
1320-122617-0039 THE MO HE CAN STARTED ON HIS FEET AND SHOOK A SHAGGY COVERING AS THOUGH THE ANIMAL HE COUNTERFEITED WAS ABOUT TO MAKE SOME DESPERATE EFFORT
1320-122617-0040 HE HAD NO OCCASION TO DELAY FOR AT THE NEXT INSTANT A BURST OF CRIES FILLED THE OUTER AIR AND RAN ALONG THE WHOLE EXTENT OF THE VILLAGE
1320-122617-0041 UNCAS CAST HIS SKIN AND STEPPED FORTH IN HIS OWN BEAUTIFUL PROPORTIONS
1580-141083-0000 I WILL ENDEAVOUR IN MY STATEMENT TO AVOID SUCH TERMS AS WOULD SERVE TO LIMIT THE EVENTS TO ANY PARTICULAR PLACE OR GIVE A CLEE AS TO THE PEOPLE CONCERNED
1580-141083-0001 I HAD ALWAYS KNOWN HIM TO BE RESTLESS IN HIS MANNER BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION HE WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF UNCONTROOLLLABLE AGITATION THAT IT WAS CLEAR SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL HAD OCCURRED
1580-141083-0002 MY FRIEND'S TEMPER HAD NOT IMPROVED SINCE HE HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THE CONGENIAL SURROUNDINGS A BAKER STREET
1580-141083-0003 WITHOUT HIS SCRAP BOOKS HIS CHEMICALS AND HIS HOMELY TIDINESS HE WAS AN UNCOMFORTABLE MAN
1580-141083-0004 I HAD TO READ IT OVER CAREFULLY AS THE TEXT MUST BE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT
1580-141083-0005 I WAS ABSENT RATHER MORE THAN AN HOUR
1580-141083-0006 THE ONLY DUP WITHIC THAT WHICH EXISTED SO FAR AS I KNEW WAS THAT WHICH BELONGED TO MY SERVANT BANISTER A MAN WHO HAS LOOKED AFTER MY ROOM FOR TEN YEARS AND WHOSE HONESTY IS ABSOLUTELY ABOVE SUSPICION
1580-141083-0007 THE MOMENT I LOOKED AT MY TABLE I WAS AWARE THAT SOMEONE HAD RUMBAGEEDD AMONG MY PAPERS
1580-141083-0008 THE PROOF WAS IN THREE LONG SLIPS I HAD LEFT THEM AL TOGETHER
1580-141083-0009 THELL TURNED OF WAS THAT SOMEONE PASSING HAD OBSERVED THE KEY IN THE DOOR HAD KNOWN THAT I WAS OUT AND HAD ENTERED TO LOOK AT THE PAPERS
1580-141083-0010 I GAVE HIM A LITTLE BRANDY AND LEFT HIM COLLAPED IN A CHAIRHILE I MADE A MOST CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE ROOM
1580-141083-0011 A BROKEN TIP OF LEAD WAS LYING THERE ALSO
1580-141083-0012 NOT ONLY THIS BUT ON THE TABLE I FOUND A SMALL BALL OF BLACK DOLL OR CLAY WITH SPECKS OF SOMETHING WHICH LOOKS LIKE SAW USIN IT
1580-141083-0013 ABOVE ALL THINGS I DESIRE TO SETTLE THE MATTER QUIETLY AND DISCREETLY
1580-141083-0014 TO THE BEST OF MY BELIEF THEY WERE ROLLED UP
1580-141083-0015 DID ANYONE KNOW THAT THESE PROOFS WOULD BE THERE NO ONE SAVE THE PRINTER
1580-141083-0016 I WAS IN SUCH A HURRY TO COME TO YOU YOU LEFT YOUR DOOR OPEN

1580-141083-0021 THERE IS NO OPENING EXCEPT THE ONE PAIN SAID I LEARNED TO GUIDE
1580-141083-0022 I AM AFRAID THERE ARE NO SIGNS HERE SAID HE

1580-141083-0028 THEN HE TOSSED IT DOWN AND SEIZED THE NEXT
1580-141083-0029 HE WAS IN THE MIDST OF THAT WHEN YOUR RETURN CAUSED HIM TO MAKE A VERY HURRIED RETREAT VERY HURRIED SINCE HE HAD NOT TIME TO REPLACE THE PAPERS WHICH WOULD TELL YOU THAT HE HAD BEEN THERE
1580-141083-0030 MISTER SOMS WAS SOMEAT OVERWHELMED BY THIS FLOOD OF INFORMATION

1580-141084-0050 IF MISTER SM SAW THEM THE GAME WAS UP
1995-1826-0000 IN THE DEBATE BETWEEN THE SENIOR SOCIETIES HER DEFENCE OF THE FIFTEENTHMENDMENT HAD BEEN NOT ONLY A NOTABLE BIT OF REASONING BUT DELIVERED WITH REAL ENTHUSIASM
1995-1826-0001 THE SOUTH SHE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF SERIOUSLY AND YET KNOWING OF ITS DELIGHTFUL HOSPITALITY AND MILD CLIMATE SHE WAS NOT AVERSE TO CHARLEST IN OR NEW ORLEANS

1995-1826-0017 THERE MIGHT BE A BIT OF FORTRY HERE AND THERE BUT MOST OF HIS PLACE WAS SUCH DESPERATE PROOWS
1995-1826-0018 HER REGARD SHIFTED TO THE GREEN STOCKS AND LEAVES AGAIN AND SHE STARTED TO MOVE AWAY

1995-1837-0000 HE KNEW THE SILVER FLEECE IS AENSOR AS MUST BE RUINED
1995-1837-0001 IT WAS THE FIRST GREAT SORROW OF HIS LIFE IT WAS NOT SO MUCH THE LOSS OF THE COTTON ITSELF BUT THE FANTASY THE HOPES THE DREAMS BUILT A ROUND IT
1995-1837-0002 I THE SWAMP THE CREL SWAMTH
1995-1837-0003 THE REVELATION OF HIS LOVE LIGHTED AND BRIGHTGEN SLOWLY TILL IT FLAMED LIKE A SUNRISE OVER HIM AND LEFT HIM IN BURNING WONDER
1995-1837-0004 HE BANTED TO KNOW IF SHE TOO KNEW OR NEW AND CARED NOT WHO CARED AND KNEW NOT
1995-1837-0005 SHE WAS SO STRANGE IN HUMAN A CREATURE
1995-1837-0006 THE WORLD WAS WATER VEILED IN MISTS
1995-1837-0007 THEN OF A SUDDENED MIDDAY THE SUN SHOADOW HODD AND STILL NO BREATH OF AIR STIRRED THE SKY WAS LIKE BLUSE STEELED OF THE EARTH' STEAM
1995-1837-0008 WHERE WAS THE USE OF IMAGINING
1995-1837-0009 THE LEGO HAD BEEN LEVEL WITH THE DIK'S AWAKE AGO AND NOW
1995-1837-0010 PERHAPS SHE TOO MIGHT BE THERE WAITING WEEPING
1995-1837-0011 HE STARTED AT THE THOUGHT HE HURRIED FORTH SADLY
1995-1837-0012 HE SPLASHED TO STAMPED ALONG FARTHER AND FARTHER ONWARD UNTIL HE NEAR THE RAMPARD OF THE CLEARING AND PUT FOOT UPON THE TREE BRIDGE
1995-1837-0013 THEN HE LOOKED DOWN THE LEGOON WAS DRY
1995-1837-0014 HE STOOD A MOMENT BEWILDERED THEN TURNED AND RUSHED UPON THE ISLAND A GREAT SHEET OF DAZZLING SUNLIGHT SWEPT THE PLACE AND BENEATH LAY A MIGHTY MASS OFOL OF GREEN THICK TALL WET AND WILLOWY
1995-1837-0015 THE SQUARES OF COTTON SHARP EDGED HEAVY WERE JUST ABOUT TO BST OF BULLS
1995-1837-0016 BUT ONE LONG MOMENTY HE PAUSED STUPID A GATE WITH UTTER AMAZEMENT THEN LEINGED DIZZILY AGAINST THE TREE
1995-1837-0017 HE GAZED ABOUT REPLEXED ASTONISHED
1995-1837-0018 HERE LAY THE READING OF THE RIDDLE WITH INFINITE WORK AND PAIN SOME ONEE HAD DOTHERED THEAL FROM THE LEGOON TO THE CREEK INTO WHICH THE FORMER HAD DRAINED BY LONG AND COOKED WAY THUS ALLOWING ITS THE EMPTY DIRECTLY
1995-1837-0019 HE SAT DOWN WEAK BEWILDERED AND ONE THOUGHT WAS UPPERMOST SORRA
1995-1837-0020 THE YEARS OF THE DAYS OF HER DYING WERE TEN
1995-1837-0021 THE HOPE AND DREAM OF HARVEST WAS UPON THE LAND
1995-1837-0022 UP IN THE SICK ROOMS OR LAY ON THE LITTLE WHITE BED
1995-1837-0023 THE NET AND WEB OF ENDLESS THINGS HAD BEEN CRAWLING AND CREEPING AROUND HER SHE HAD STRUGGLED IN DUMB SPEECHLESS TERROR AGAINST SOME MIGHTY GRASPING THAT STROLL FOR HER LIFE WAS GNARLED AND CREEPING FINGERS BUT NOW AT LAST WEAKLY SHE OPENED HER EYES AND QUESTIONED
1995-1837-0024 FOR WHILE SHE LAY IN HER CHAIR INHPPY DREAMY PLEASURE AT SUN AND BIRD AND TREE
1995-1837-0025 SHE ROSE WITH A FLEETING GLANCE GATHERED THE SHAWL ARUND HER THEN GLIDING FORWARD WAVERING TREMULOUS SLIPPED ACROSS THE ROAD INTO THE SWAMP
1995-1837-0026 SHE HAD BEEN BORN WITHIN ITS SPORTERS WITHIN HIS BOR AS SHE HAD LIVED AND GROWN AND WITHIN ITS BORDER SHE HAD MET HER LOVE
1995-1837-0027 ON SHE HURRIED UNTIL SWEEPING DOWN TO THE LAGOON AND THE ISLAND LOW THE COTTON LAY BEFORE HER
1995-1837-0028 THE CHAIR WAS EMPTY BUT HE KNEW
1995-1837-0029 HE DIARTED THROUGH THE TREES AND PAUSED A TALL MAN STRONGLY BUT SLIMLY MADE
2094-142345-0000 IT IS A VERY FINE OLD PLACE OF RED BRICK SOFTENED BY A PALE POWDERY LIKN WHICH HAS DISPERSED ITSELF WITH HAPPY IRREGULARITY S AS TO BRING THE RED BRICK INTO TERMS OF FRIENDLY CONPANIONSHIP WITH A LIMESTONE ORNAMENTS SURROUNDING THE THREE GABLES THE WINDOWS AND THE DOORPLACE
2094-142345-0001 BUT THE WINDOWS ARE PATCHED WITH WOODEN PANES AND THE DOOR I THINK IS LIKE THE GATE IT IS NEVER OPENED
2094-142345-0002 FOR IT IS A SOLID HEAVY HANDSOME DOOR AND MUST ONCE HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF SHUTTING WITH A SANOROUS BAYING BEHIND THE LIVERED LACKEY WHO HAD JUST SEEN HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS OFF THE GROUNDS IN A CARRIAGE AND PAIR
2094-142345-0003 A LARGE OPEN FIREPLACE WITH RUSTY DOGS IN IT AND A BARE BOARDED FLOOR AT THE FAR END FLEECES OF WOOL STACKED UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR SOME EMPTY CORN BAGS
2094-142345-0004 AND WHAT THROUGH THE LEFT HAND WINDOW
2094-142345-0005 SEVERAL CLOTHES HORSES APELLION A SPINNING WHEEL AND AN OLD BOX WIDE OPEN AND STUFFED FULL OF COLORED RAGS
2094-142345-0006 AT THE EDGE OF THIS BOX THEIR LIES A GREAT WOODENLL WHICH SO FAR AS MUTILATION IS CONCERN BEARS A STRONG RESEMBLANCE TO THE FINEST GREEK SCULPTURE AND ESPECIALLY IN THE TOTAL LOSS OF ITS NOSE
2094-142345-0007 THE HISTORY OF THE HOUSE HA IS PLAIN NOW
2094-142345-0008 BUT THERE IS ALWAYS A STRONGER SENSE OF LIFE WHEN THE SUN IS BRILLIANT AFTER RAIN AND NOW HE IS POURING DOWN HIS BEAMS AND MAKING SPARKLES AMONG THE WET STRAW AND LIGHTING UP EVERY PATCH OF VIVID GREEN MOSS ON THE RED TILES OF THE COWSHED AND TURNING EVEN THE MUDDY WATER THAT IS HURRYING ALONG THE CHANNEL TO THE DRAIN INTO A MIRROR FOR THE YELLOW BUILD DUCKS WHO ARE SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY OF GETTING A DRINK WITH AS MUCH BODY IN IT AS POSSIBLE
2094-142345-0009 FOR THE GREAT BARN DOORS ARE THROWN WIDE OPEN AND MEN ARE BUSY THERE MENDING THE HARNESS UNDER THE SUPERINTENDENTS OF MISTER GOBY THE WIDAH OTHERWISE SADDLER WHO ENTERTAINS THEM WITH THE LATEST TREADLESTON GOSSIP
2094-142345-0010 HADY SIRREL OFTEN TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY WHEN HER ANT'S BACK WAS TURNED OF LOOKING AT THE PLEASING REFLECTION OF HERSELF IN THOSE POLISHED SERVICES FOR THE OAK TABLE WAS USUALLY TURNED UP LIKE A SCREEN AND WAS MORE FOR ORNAMENT THAN FOR USE AND SHE COULD SEE HERSELF SOMETIMES IN THE GREAT ROUND PEUT DISHES THEY WERERRANGED ON THE SHELLS ABOVE THE LONG DEAL DINNER TABLE OR IN THE HOBS OF THE GREAT WHICH ALWAYS SHN LIKE JASPER
2094-142345-0011 DO NOT SUPPOSE HOWEVER THAT MISSUS POYSER WAS ELDERLY OR SHREWISH AND HER APPEARANCE SHE WAS A GOOD LOOKING WOMAN NOT MORE THAN EIGHT AND THIRTY A FAIR COMPLEXION AND SANDY HAIR WELL SHAPEN LIGHT FOOTED
2094-142345-0012 THE FAMILY LIKENESS BETWEEN HER AND HER NIECE DINIMORUS WITH A CONTRAST BETWEEN HER KEENNESS AND DYNIS SERRAFIC GENTLENESS OF EXPRESSION MIGHT HAVE SERVED A PAINTER AS AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION FOR A MARTHA AND MERRY
2094-142345-0013 HER TONGUE WAS NOT LESS KEEN THAN HER EYE AND WHENEVER A DAMANCEIL CAME WITH AEAR SHOT SEEMED TO TAKE UP AN UNFINISHED LOOKURE AS A BARREL ORGAN TAKES SU UPP ATUNE PRECISELY AT THE POINT WHERE IT HAD LEFT OFF
2094-142345-0014 THE FACT THAT IT WAS CHURNING DAY WAS ANOTHER REASONHY IT WAS INCONVENIENT TO HAVE THE WIDOW US AND WHY CONSEQUENTLY MISSUS POYSER SHOULD SCOLD MOLLY THE HOUSE MADEAID WITH UNUSUAL SEVERITY
2094-142345-0015 DW ALL APPEARANCE MOLLYE HAD GOT THROUGH HER AFTER IT IN HER WORK IN AN EXEMPL MANNER HAD CLEANED HERSELF WITH GREAT DESPATCH AND NOW CAME TO ASK SUBMISSIIVEBLY IF SHE SHOULD SIT DOWN TO HER SPINNING TILL MILKING TIME

2094-142345-0029 DID EVER ANYBODY SEE THE LINK SCREAMED AS HIS POYSER RUNNING TOWARDS THE TABLE WHEN HER EYE HAD FALLEN ON THE BLUE STREAM
2094-142345-0030 TOTDY HOWEVER HAD DESCENDED FROM HER CHAIR WITH GREAT SWIFTNESS AND WAS ALREADY IN RETREAT TOWARDS THE DAIRY WITH A SORT OF WADDLING RUN AND AN AMOUNT OF FAT ON THE NAPE OF HER NECK WHICH MADE HER LOOKED LIKE THE MEDAMORPHOSIS OF A WHITE SUCKLING PIG
2094-142345-0031 AND SHE WAS VERY FOND OF FEW TOO INT RACHEL
2094-142345-0032 I OFTEN HEARD HER TALK OF YOU IN THE SAME SORT OF WAY
2094-142345-0033 WHEN SHE HAD THAT MAN ILLNESS AND I WAS ONLY ELEVEN YEARS OLD SHE USED TO SAY YOU'LL HAVE A FRIEND ON EARTH IN YOUR AUNT RACHEL IF I AM TAKEN FROM YOU FOR SHE HAS A KIND HEART AND I'M SURE I FOUND IT SO
2094-142345-0034 AND THERE'S LINDEN IN THE HOUSE AS I COULD WELL SPARE YOU FOR I GOT LOTS A SHEETING AND TABLE CLOTHING AND TOWINGS ISN IT MADE UP

2094-142345-0042 I HAD A COMMON IMPATIENCE WITH YOU
2094-142345-0043 BY THIS TIME THE TWO GENTLEMEN HAD REACHED THE PAALINGS AND HAD GOT DOWN FROM THEIR HORSES HE WAS PLAYING THEY MEANT TO COME IN
2094-142345-0044 SAID MISTER IRWINE WITH HIS STATELY CORDIALITY
2094-142345-0045 OH SIR DON'T MENTION IT SAID MISSUS POYSER
2094-142345-0046 I DELIGHT IN YOUR KITCHEN
2094-142345-0047 POYSER IS NOT AT HOME IS HE
2094-142345-0048 SAID CAPTAIN DY THORNE SITTING HIMSELF WHERE HE COULD SE ALONG THE SHORT PASSAGE TO THE OPEN DR DOOR
2094-142345-0049 NO SIR HE ISN'T HE'S GONE TO RECIDOR TO SEE MISTER WEST THE FACTOR ABOUT THE WOOL

2094-142345-0055 BUT YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT THAN I'D DO SIR
2094-142345-0056 I THINK I SHOULD BE DOING YOU A SERVICE TO TURN YOU OUT OF SUCH A PLACE
2094-142345-0057 I KNOWS FARM ISN'T BETTER ORDER THAN ANY OTHER WITHIN TEN MILES OF US THAN AS FOR THE KITCHEN HE ADDED SMILING I DON'T BELIEVE THERE' IS ONE IN THE KINGDOM TO BEAT IT
2094-142345-0058 BY THE BY I HAVEVE NEVER SEEN YOUR DAIRY ANDST SEE HER DARY MISSUS POYSER
2094-142345-0059 THIS MISSUS POSER SAID BLUSHING AND BELIEVING THAT THE CAPTAIN WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN HER MILT PANS AND WOULD ADJUST HIS OPINION OF HER TO THE APPEARANCE OF HER DAIRY
2094-142345-0060 OH I'VE NO DOUBT IT'S IN CAPITAL ORDER
2300-131720-0000 THE PARIS PLANED LIKE THAT OF THE CRYSTAL PALACE WAS A TEMPORARY EXHIBIT
2300-131720-0001 THE LONDON PLANT WAS LESS TEMPORARY BUT NOT PERMANENT SUPPLYING BEFORE IT WAS TOURN OUT NO FEWER THAN THREE THOUSAND LAMPS IN HOTELS CHURCHES STORES AND DWELLINGS IN THE VICINITY OF HOLBORN VIADAR
2300-131720-0002 THERE MESSI IS JOHNSON AND HAMER PUT INTO PRACTICE MANY OF THE IDEAS NOW STANDARD IN THE ART AND SECURED MUCH USEFUL DATA FOR THE WORK IN NEW YORK OF WHICH THE STORY HAS JUST BEEN TOLD
2300-131720-0003 THE DNAMAL ELECTRIC MACHINE THOUGHSE SMALL WAS ROBUST FOR UNDER ALL THE VARYING SPEEDS OF WATER POWER AND THE VICISICITUDES OF THE PLANT TO WHICH IT BELONG IT CONTINUED AN ACTIVE USE UNTIL EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE SEVENTEEN YEARS
2300-131720-0004 OWING TO HIS INSISTENCE ON LOW PRESSURE DIRECT CURRENT FOR USE IN DENSELY POPULATED DISTRICTS AS THE ONLY SAFE AND TRULY UNIVERSAL PROFITABLE WAY OF DELIVERING ELECTRICAL ENERGY TO THE CONSUMERS ADDISON HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY SPOKEN OF AS AN OPPONENT OF THE ALTERNATING CURRENT
2300-131720-0005 WHY IF WE ERECTE STATION AT THE FALLS IT IS A GREAT ECONOMY TO GET IT UP TO THE CITY
2300-131720-0006 THERE SEEMS NO GOOD REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT IT WILL CHANGE
2300-131720-0007 BROT AS THE PRAIRIES AND FREE IN THOUGHT AS THE WINDS THAT SWEPT THEM HE IS IDIOT SINCTICALLY OPPOSED TO LOOSE AND WASTEFUL METHODS TO PLANS OF EMPIRE THAT NEGLECT THE POOR AT THE GATE
2300-131720-0008 EVERYTHING HE HAS DONE HAS BEEN AIMED THAT THE CONSURBATION OF ENERGY THE CONTRACTION OF SPACE THE INTENSIFICATION OF CULTURE
2300-131720-0009 FOR SOME YEARS IT WAS NOT FOUND THEEASIBLE TO OPERATE MOTORS ON ALTERNATING CURRANT CIRCUITS AND THAT REASON WAS OFTEN URGED AGAINST IT SERIOUSLY
2300-131720-0010 IT COULD NOT BE USED FOR ELECTRAL PLATING OR DEPOSITION NOR COULD IT CHARGE STOREGE BATTERIES ALL OF WHICH ARE EASILY WITHIN THE AABILITY OF THE DIRECURRENT
2300-131720-0011 BUT WHEN IT CAME TO BE A QUESTION OF LIGHTING A SCATTERED SUBURB A GROUP OF DWELLINGS ON THE OUTSKIRTS A REMOTE COUNTRY RESNENCE OR A FARMUSE THE ALTERNATING CURRENT IN ALL ELEMENTS SAVE ITS DANGER WAS ANDASS IDEAL
2300-131720-0012 AEDISON WAS INTOLERANT OF SHAMIN SHODDIY AND NOTHING WOULD SATISFY HIM THAT COULD NOT STAND CROSS EXAMINATION BY MICHER SCOPE TESTUBE AND GAALVENOMETER
2300-131720-0013 UNLESS HE COULD SECURE AN ENGINE OF SMOOTH RUNNING AND MORE EXACTLY GOVERNMENT REGULATED THAN THOSE AVLLIBLE FOR HIS DNAMO AND LAMPDDISON REALIZE THAT HE WOULD FIND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE A STEADY LIGHT
2300-131720-0014 MISTER ADISON WAS A LEADER FAR AHEAD OF THE TIME
2300-131720-0015 HE OBTAINED THE DESIRED SPEED AND LOAD WITH A FRICTION BREAK ALSO REGULATOR OF SPEED BUT WAITED FOR AN INDICATORED A VERIFY IT
2300-131720-0016 THEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO KNOWN WAY TO LUBERICAT AN ENGINE FOR CONTINUOUS RUNNING AND MISTERTISON INFORM ME THAT AS A MARINE ENGINE STARTED BEFORE THE SHIP LEFT NEW YORK AND CONTINUED RUNNING UNTIL IT REACHED ITS HOME PORT SO AN ENGINE FOR HIS PURPOSES MUST PRODUCED LIGHT AT ALL TIMES
2300-131720-0017 ANDISON HAD INSTALLED HIS HISTORIC FIRST GREAT CENTRAL STATION SYSTEM IN NEW YORK ON THE MULTIABLE ARC SYSTEM COVERED BY HIS FEEDER AND MAIN INVENTION WHICH RESULTED IN A NOTABLE SAVING IN THE COST OF CONDUCTORS AS AGAINST A STRAATE TOO WIRE SYSTEM THROUGHOUT OF THE TREE KIND
2300-131720-0018 HE SOON FORCEW THAT STILL GREATER ECONEOMY WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR COMMERCIAL SUCCESS NOT ALONE FOR THE LARGER TERRITORY OPENING BUT FOR THE COMPACT DISTRICT OF LARGE CITIES
2300-131720-0019 THE STRONG POSITION HELD BY THE ATEDISCENT SYSTEM UNDER THE STRENUOUS COMPETITION IT WAS ALREADY SPRINGING UP WAS ENORMOUSLY IMPROVED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF THE THREE WIRE SYSTEM AND HE GAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPETUS TO INCONDCENT LIGHTING
2300-131720-0020 IT WAS SPECIALLY SUITED FOR A TRIAL PLT ALSO IN THE EARLY DAYS WHEN YIELD OF SIX OR EIGHT LAMPS TO THE HORSE POWER WAS CONSIDER SUBJECT FOR CONGRATULATION
2300-131720-0021 THE STREET CONDUCTORS WERE OF THE OVERHEAD WHOLE LINE CONSTRUCTION AD WERE INSTALLED BY THE CONSTRUCTION COMPANY THAT HAD BEEN ORGANIZED BY ADISCENT TO BUILD AN EQUIPE CENTRAL STATIONS
2300-131720-0022 MEANWHILE HE HAD CALLED UPON ME TO MAKE A REPORT OF THE THREEIR SYSTEM KNOWN IN ENGLAND AS THE HOPKINSON BOTH DOCTOR JOHN HOPKINSON AND MISTER ETISENT BEING INDEPENDENT INVENORS AT PRACTICALLY THE SAME TIME
2300-131720-0023 I THINK HE WAS PERHAPS MORE APPRECIATIVE THAT I WAS OF THE DISCIPLINE OF THE ADDISENT CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR US TO WAIT UNTIL THE MORNING THE FOURTH BEFORE WE STARTED UP
2300-131720-0024 BUT THE PLANT RAN AND IT WAS THE FIRST THREE WIRE STATION IN THIS COUNTRY
2300-131720-0025 THEY WERE LATER USED AS RESERVE MACHINES AND FINALLY WITH THE ENGINE RETIRED FROM SERVICE AS PART OF THE COLLECTION OF AT AS SONIA BUT THEY REMAINED IN PRACTICALLY AS GOOD CONDITION AS WHEN INSTALLED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE
2300-131720-0026 THE ARC LAMP AND STALLED OUTSIDE A CUSTOMERS PREMISES OR IN A CIRCUIT FOR PUBLIC STREET LIGHTING BURNED SO MANY HOURS NIGHTLY SO MANY NIGHTS IN THE MONTH AND WAS PAID FOR AT THAT RATE SUBJECT TO REBATE FORO HOURS WHEN THE LAMP MIGHT BE OUT THROUGH ACCIDENT
2300-131720-0027 EVISENT HELD THAT THE ELECTRICITY SOLD MUST BE MEASURED JUST LIKE GAS OR WATER AND HE PROCEEDED TO DEVELOP A METTER
2300-131720-0028 THERE WAS INFINITE SKEPTUSISM AROUND HIM ON THE SUBJECT AND WHILE OTHER INVENTORS WERE ALSO GIVING THE SUBJECT ME THOUGHT THE PUBLIC TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT ANYTHING SO UTTERLY INTANGIBLE AS ELECTRICITY THAT COULD NOT BE SEEN OR WEIGH AND ONLY GAVE SECONDARY EVIDENCE OF ITSELF AT THE EXACT POINTED USE COULD NOT BE BROUGHT TO ACCURATE REGISTRATION
2300-131720-0029 HENCE THE ADISON ELECTRLITIC METER IS NO LONGER USED DESPITE ITS EXCELLENT QUALITIES
2300-131720-0030 THE PRINCIPLE EMPLOYED IN THE ADISENT ELECTRLITIC METRE IS THAT WHICH EXEMPLIFIES THE POWER OF ELECTRICITY TO DECOM IMPOSE A CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE
2300-131720-0031 ASSOCIATED WITH THE SIMPLE FORM OF APPARATUS WERE VARIOUS INGENIOUS DETAABLEES AND REFINEMENTS TO SECURE REGULARITY OF OPERATION FREEDOM FROM INACCURACY AND IMMUNITY FROM SUCH TAMPERING AS WOULD PERMIT THEFT OF CURRENT OR DAMAGE
2300-131720-0032 THE STANDARD EEDIS IN MEER PRACTICE WAS TO REMOVE THE CELLS ONCE AMONTH TO THE MEATOR ROOM OF THE CENTRAL STATION COMPANY FOR EXAMINATION ANOTHER SAT BEING SUBSTITUTED
2300-131720-0033 IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT MISTER DUBY J JENKS READ AN INTERESTING PAPER BEFORE THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL LA ENGINEERS ON THE SIX YEARS OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE HAD UP TO THAT TIME WITH THE METTER THEN MORE GENERALLY IN USED THAN ANY OTHER
2300-131720-0034 THE OTHERS HAVING BEEN IN OPERATION TOO SHORT A TIME TO SHOW DEFINITE RESULTS ALTHOUGH THEY ALSO WHEN QUICKLY TO A DIVID AND BASIS
2300-131720-0035 IN THIS CONNECTION IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED THAT THE ASSOCIATION OF ETISENT ILLUMINATING COMPANIES IN THE SAME YEAR ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS UNANIMOUSLY TO THE EFFECT THAT THE EEDNISCENT MEEDTER WAS ACCURATE AND THAT ITS USE WAS NOT EXPENSIVE FOR STATIONS ABOVE ONE THOUSAND LIGHTS AND THAT THE BEST FINANCIAL RESULTS WERE INVARIABLY SECURED IN A STATION SELLING CURRENT BY METTER
2300-131720-0036 THE METOR CONTINUED IN GENERAL SERVICE DURING EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE AND PROBABLY UP TO THE CLOTHES OF THE CENTURY
2300-131720-0037 HE WEIGHED AND REWAVED THE METTER PLATES AND PURSUED EVERY LINE OF INVESTIGATION IMAGINABLE BUT ALL IN VAIN
2300-131720-0038 HE FELT HE WAS UP AGAINST IT AND THAT PERHAPS AN OTHER KIND OF A JOB WOULD SUIT HIM BETTER
2300-131720-0039 THE PROBLEM WAS SOALT
2300-131720-0040 WE WERE MORE INTERESTED IN THE TECHNICAL CONDITION OF THE STATION THAN IN THE COMMERCIAL PART
2300-131720-0041 WE HAD MES IN WHICH THEY WERE TWO BOTTLES OF LIQUID
237-126133-0000 HERE SHE WOULD STAY COMFORTED AND SOTHE AMONG THE LOVELY PLANTS AND RICH' SASOTICS REJOICING THE HEART OF OLD TURNER THE GARDENER WHO SINCE POLLY'S FIRST RAPTEROUS ENTRANCE HAD TAKEN HER INTO HIS GOOD GRACES FOR ALL TIME
237-126133-0001 EVERY CHANCE SHE COULD STEAL AFTER PRACTICE HOURS WERE OVER AND AFTER THE CLAMOROUS A MANDS OF THE BOYS UPON HER TIME WERE FULLY SATISFIED WAS SEIZED TO FLY ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND TO THE FLOWERS
237-126133-0002 THEN DEAR SAID MISSUS WHITNEY YOU MUST BE KINDDER TO HER THAN EVER THINK WHAT IT WOULD BE FOR ONE OF YOU TO BE AWAY FROM HOME EVEN AMONG FRIENDS
237-126133-0003 SOMEHOW OF ALL THE DAYS WHEN THE HOME FEELING WAS THE STRONGEST THIS DAY IT SEEMED AS IF SHE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER
237-126133-0004 IF SHE COULD ONLY SEE PHRONSIE FOR JUST ONE MOMENT
237-126133-0005 OH SHE'S ALWAYS AT THE PIANO SAID MAN SHE MUST BE THERE NOW SOMEWHERE AND THEN SOMEBODY LAUGHED
237-126133-0006 AT THIS THE BUNDLE OPENED SUDDENLY AND OUT POPPED PHRONSIE
237-126133-0007 BUT POLLY COULDN'T SPEAK AND IF A JASPER HADN'T CAUGHTTERED JUST IN TIME SHE WOULD HAVE TUMBLED OVER BACKWARD FROM A STOOL PHRONSIE AND ALL
237-126133-0008 ASKED PHRONSIE WITH HER LITTLE FACE CLOSE A POLLY'S OWN

237-126133-0014 ASKED PHRONSIE IN INTENSE INTEREST SLIPPING DOWN OUT OF POLLY'S ARMS AND CROWDING UP CLOSE TO JASPER SIDE
237-126133-0015 YES ALL ALONE BY HIMSELF ASSERTED JASPER BEHEMENTLY AND WINKING FURIOUSLY TO THE OTHERS TO STOP THERE LAUGHPING HE DID NOW TRULY PHRONSIE
237-126133-0016 OH NO CHAAPSTER I MUST GO BY MY VERY OWNSELF
237-126133-0017 BA JAP YOUVE CAUGHT IT LAP PURSY WHILE THE OTHERS SCREAMED AT THE SIGHT OF JASPER'S FACE

237-126133-0020 HOW DID HER MOTHER EVER LET HER GO
237-126133-0021 SHE ASKED IMPULSIVELY I DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU COULD PERSUADE HER FATHER
237-126133-0022 I DIDN'T HAVE ANY FEARS IF I WORKED IT RIGHTLY SAID THE OLD GENTLEMEN COMPLACENTLY
237-126133-0023 HE CRIED AND HIGH DUDGEON JUST AS IF HE OWNED THE WHOLE OF THE PEPPS AND COULD DISPOSE OF THEM ALL HIS SUIT HIS FANCY
237-126133-0024 AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS SO DELIGHTED WITH HIS SUCCESS THAT HE HAD TO BURST OUT INTO A SERIES OF SHORT HAPPY BITS OF LAUGHTER THAT OCCUPIED QUITE A SPACE OF TIME
237-126133-0025 AT LAST HE CAME OUT OF THEM AND WIPED HIS FACE VIGOROUSLY
237-134493-0000 IT IS SIXTEEN YEARS SINCE JOHN BURGS AND DIED
237-134493-0001 HIS WIFE NOW EES BESIDE HIM AND THE WHITE SHAFT THAT MARKS THEIR GRAVES GLEAMS ACROSS THE WHEAT FIELDS
237-134493-0002 FROM THE NORWEGIAN GRAVEYARD ONE LOOKS OUT OVER A VAST CHECKERBOARD MARKED OFF IN SQUARES OF WHEAT AND CORN LIGHT AND DARK DARK AND LIGHT
237-134493-0003 FROM THE GRAVE YARD GATE ONE CAN COWNT A DOZEN GAILY PAINTED FARMHUSS THE GILDED WEATHER VEINS ON THE BIG RED BARNS WINK AT EACH OTHER ACROSS THE GREEN AND BROWN AND YELLOW FIELDS
237-134493-0004 THE AIR AND THE EAR FAR CURIOUSLY MADETED AND INTERMINGLED AS IF THE ONE WERE THE BREATH OF THE OTHER
237-134493-0005 HE WAS A SPLENDID FIGURE OF A BOY TALL AND STRAIGHT AS A YOUNG PINE TREE WITH A HANDSOME HEAD AND STORMY GRAY EYES DEEPLY SET UNDER A SERIOUS BROW
237-134493-0006 THAT'S NOT MUCH OF A JOB FOR AN ATHLETE HERE I'VE BEEN TO TOWN AND BACK

237-134500-0001 MARI SIGHED
237-134500-0002 A BRISKQIND HAD COME UP AND WAS DRIVING PUFFY WHITE CLOUDS ACROSS THE SKY
237-134500-0003 THE A ORCHARD WAS SPARKLING AND RIPPLING IN THE SUN
237-134500-0004 THAT INVITATION DECIDED HER

237-134500-0011 AREN'TUS BLASHED LOOK AT A SPIDER WEIBS ALL OVER THE GRASS
237-134500-0012 IN A FEW MOMENTS HE HEARD THE CHERRIS DROPPING SMARTLY INTO THE PALE AND HE BEGAN TO SWING HIS SIGHTH WITH THAT LONG EVEN STROKE THAT FEW AMERICAN BOYS EVER LEARNED
237-134500-0013 MURRY PICKED CHERRIS AND SANG SOFTLY TO HERSELF STRIPPING ONE GLITTERING RANCH AFTER ANOTHER SHIVERING WHEN SHE CAUGT A SHOWER OF RAINDROP ON HER NECK AND HAIR
237-134500-0014 AND AMILL MODE HIS WAY SLOWLY DOWN TOWARD THE CHERRY TREES
237-134500-0015 THAT SUMMER THE RAINS HAD BEEN SO MANY AND OPPERORTUNE THAT IT WAS ALMOST MORE THAN CHBADA AND HIS MAN COULD DO TO KEEP UP WITH THE CORN THE ORCHARD WAS AN NEGLECTED WILDERNESS

237-134500-0017 IF I FEEL THAT WAY I FEEL THAT WAY
237-134500-0018 HE REACHED UP AMONG THE BRANCHES AND BEGAN TO PICK THE SWEET INSIPPET FRUIT LONG IVORY COLURED BERRIES TIPPED WITH MAINT PINK LIKE WHITE CORAL THAT FALL TO THE GROUND UNHEEDED ALL SUMMERTH
237-134500-0019 HE DROPPED A HANDFUL INTO HER LAP

260-123286-0000 SATURDAY AUGUST FIFTEENTH THE SEA AND BROKEN ALL ROUND NO LAND IN SIGHT
260-123286-0001 THE HORIZON SEEMS EXTREMELY DISTANT
260-123286-0002 ALL MY DANGER AND SUFFERINGS WERE NEEDED TO STRIKE A SPARK OF HUMAN FEELING OUT OF HIM BUT NOW THAT I AM WELL HIS NATURE HAS RESUMED ITS SWAY
260-123286-0003 YOU SEEM ANXIOUS MY UNCLE I SAID SEEING HIM CONTINUALLY WITH HIS GLASS TO HIS EYEGES
260-123286-0004 ONE MIGHT BE WOULD LESS REASON AND NOW
260-123286-0005 I AM NOT COMPLAINING THAT THE RIGHTEST SLOW BUT THAT THE SEA IS SO WIDE
260-123286-0006 WE WASING TIME AND THE FACT IS I HAVE NOT COME ALL THIS WAY TO TAKE A LITTLE SALE UPON A POND ON A RAFT
260-123286-0007 HE CALLED THE SEA UPON AND I LONG VOYAGE TCKING A LITTLE SALE
260-123286-0008 THEREFORE DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT VIEWS AND PROSPECTS
260-123286-0009 I TAKE THIS IS MY ANSWER AND I LEAVE THE PROFESSOR TO BUIDYE HIS LIPS WITH IMPATIENCE
260-123286-0010 SUNDAY AUGUST SIXTEENTH
260-123286-0011 NOTHING NEW WHETHER UNCHANGED THE WIND FRESHS
260-123286-0012 BUT THERE SEEMED NO REASON A FEAR
260-123286-0013 THE SHADOW OF THE RAFT WAS CLEARLY OUTLINED UPON THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES
260-123286-0014 TRULY THE SEA IS OF INFINITE WIT
260-123286-0015 IT MUST BE AS WIDE AS THE MEDITERRANEAN OR THE ATLANTIC AND WHY NOT
260-123286-0016 THESE THOUGHTS AGITATED ME ALL DAY AND MY IMAGINATION SCARCELY CALM DOWN AFTER SEVERAL HOUR ASLEEVE
260-123286-0017 I SHUDDER AS I RECALL THESE MONSTERS TO MY REMEMBRANCE
260-123286-0018 I SAW AT THE HAMBER MUS IN THE SKELETON OF ONE OF THESE CREATURES THIRTY FEET IN LENGTH
260-123286-0019 I SUPPOSE PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK WAS OF MY OPINION TO AND EVEN SHARED MY FEARS FOR AFTER HAVING EXAMINED THE PIIGCK HIS EYES TRAVERSED THE OCEAN FROM SIDE A SIDE
260-123286-0020 TUESDAY AUGUST EIGHTEENTH
260-123286-0021 DURING HIS WATCH I SLEPT
260-123286-0022 TWO HOURS AFTERWARDS A TERRIBLE SHOCK A WOE ME
260-123286-0023 THE RAFT WAS HEAVED UP ON A WRY MOUNTAIN AND PITCHED DOWN AGAIN AT A DISTANCE OF TWENTY FATHOWS
260-123286-0024 THERE'S A WELLAL A WELL CRIED THE PROFESSOR
260-123286-0025 FLIGHT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION NOW THE REP TAILS ROSE THEY WILLED AROUND OUR LITTLE RAFT WITH A RAPIDITY GREATER THAN THAT OF EXPRESSED T RAINES
260-123286-0026 TWO MONSERS ONLY RECREATING ALL THIS COMMOTION AND BEFORE MY EYES ARE TWO REPTILES OF THE PRIMITIVE WORLD
260-123286-0027 I CAN DISTINGUISH THE EYE OF IF THEOSURUS GLOWING LIKE A RED HOT CO AND AS LARGE AS A MAN'S HEAD
260-123286-0028 ITS JAWS ENORMOUS AND ACCORDING NATURALIST IT IS ARMED WITH NO LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO TEETH
260-123286-0029 THOSE HUGE CREATURES ATTACK EACH OTHER WITH A GREATEST ANIMOSITY
260-123286-0030 SUDDENLY THE ICKOSURIS AND THE PLEASEO SOURCE DISAPPEAR BELOW LEAVING A WORPOLE EDDYING IN THE WATER
260-123286-0031 AS FOR THE IF THE ASSURUS AS HE RETURNED TO HIS SUBMARING CABINN
260-123288-0000 THE ROARINS BECOME LOST IN THE DISTANCE
260-123288-0001 THE WEATHER IF WE MAY USE THE TERM WILL CHANGE BEFORE LONG
260-123288-0002 THE ATMOSPHER IS CHARGED WITH VAPORS PERVADED WITH THE ELECTRICITY GENERATED BY THE EVAPORATION OF SAILING WATERS
260-123288-0003 THE ELECTRIC LIGHT CAN SCARCELY PENETRATE TO THE DNANCE CURTAIN WHICH IS DROPPED OVER THE THEATRE ON WHICH THE BATTLE OF THE ELEMENTS IS ABOUT TO BE WAGED
260-123288-0004 THE AIR IS HEAVY THE SEA IS CALM
260-123288-0005 FROM TIME TIME A FLEASY TUFT OF MI MISS WITH YET SOME GLEAMING LIGHT LEFT UPON IT DROPP ST DOWN UPON THE DENSE FLOOR OF GRAY AND LOSES ITSELF IN THE OAKE AND IMPENETRABLE MASS
260-123288-0006 THE ATMOSPHERE AS EVIDENTLY CHARGED AND SEAR CHARGED WITH ELECTRICITY
260-123288-0007 THEIND NEVER WLLS BUT TO ACQUIRE INCREASED STRENGTH THE VAST BANK OF HEAVY CLOUDS IS A HUGE RES ORVAR A FEARFUL WINDY GUUSTS AND RUSHING STORMS
260-123288-0008 THERE'S A HEAVY STORM COMING ON I CRIED POINTING TOWARDS THE HORIZON
260-123288-0009 THOSE CLOUD SEEM AS IF THEY WERE GOING TO CRUSH THE SEA
260-123288-0010 ON THE MAST ALREADY I SEE THE LIGHT PLAY OF A LAMENT SAINT BOW'S FIRE THE OUTSTRECHS SALL CATCHES NOT A BREATH OF WIND AND HANGS LIKE SHEET OF A LED
260-123288-0011 BUT IF WE HAVE NOW CEASED TO ADVANCE WHY DO WE YET AT LEAVE THAT SAIL LOOSE WHICH AT THE FIRST SHOCK OF A TEMPEST MAY CAPSIZ US IN A MOMENT
260-123288-0012 THAT WILL BE THE SAFEIS NO NO NEVER
260-123288-0013 THE PILED UP VAPORS CONTENTST IN A WATER AND THE AIR PUT IN INTO VIOLENT ACTION TO SUPPLY THE VACIM LEFT BY THE CONDENSATION OF THE MIDST ROUSES ITSELF INTO A WORLDWIND
260-123288-0014 HAN STIRS NIGHT
260-123288-0015 FROM THE UNDER SURFACE OF THE CLOUDS THERE ARE CONTINUALATE MISSIONS OF LURD LIFE THELECTURIC MATTER IS IN CONTINUAL EVOLUTION FROM THEIR COMPONENT MOLLCHULES THE GASUS ELEMENTS OF THE AIR NEED TO BE SLKED WITH MOISTURE FOR INARMABLE COLUMNS OF WATER RUSHED UPWARDS INTO THE AIR AND FALL BACK AGAIN IN WHITE FOAM
260-123288-0016 I REFERRED TO THE THEMOMETER IT IN CAES THE FIGURE IS OBLITERATED
260-123288-0017 IS THE ATMOSPHERE CONDITIONING HAVING ONCE REACHEDSTENSITY TO BECOME FINNAL
260-123288-0018 THE RAFT BEARS ON STILL TO THE SOUTH EAST
260-123288-0019 AT NOON IN THE VIOLANCE OF THE STORM RE DOOUBLS
260-123288-0020 EACH OF US IS LASH IS SOME PART OF THE RAFT
260-123288-0021 THE WAVES RISE ABOVE OUR HEADS
260-123288-0022 THEY SEEMED TO BE WE ARE LOST BUT I AM NOT SURE
260-123288-0023 HE NOD'S HIS CONSENT
260-123288-0024 THE FARE BAALL HALF OF IT WHY HALF AZAR BLUE AND THE SIZE OF A TENT INCH SHELL MOVED SO ABOUT THE RAFT BUT REVOLVING ON ITS OWN AXIS WITH ASTONISHING PVELOCITY AS IF WHIPPED ROUND BY THE FORCE OF THE WHIRLWIND
260-123288-0025 HERE IT COMES THERE IT GLIDES NOW IT IS UP THE RAGGED STUMP OF THE MAST THAT'S IT LIGHTLY LEAPS ON THE PROVISION BAG DESCENDS WITH A LIGHT BOUND AND JUST SKIMMS THE POWDER MAGAZINE HORRIBLE
260-123288-0026 WE SHALL BE BLOWN UP BUT NO THE DAZZLING DISK OF MYSTERIOUS LIGHT NIMBLING LEAPS ASIDE IT APPROACHES HANS WHO FIXES HIS BLUE EYE UPON ITS STEDDILY IT THREATENS THE HEAD OF MY UNCLE WHO FALLS UPON HIS KNEES WITH HIS HEAD DOWN TO AVOIDED
260-123288-0027 A SUFFOCATING SMELL OF NTRACH HAD FILLS THE AIR IT ENTERS THE THROAT IT FILLS THENGS
260-123288-0028 WE SUFFERED STFLING PAINS
260-123440-0000 AND HOW ODD THE DIRECTIONS WILL LOOK
260-123440-0001 POOR ALICE

260-123440-0004 ALICE TOOKOOK THE FAN AND GLOVES AND AS THE HALL WAS VERY HOT SHE KEPT FANNING HERSELF ALL THE TIME SHE WENT ON TALKY DEAR DEAR HOW QUEER EVERYTHING IS TO DAY
260-123440-0005 AND YESTERDAY THANS WENT ON JUST AS USUAL
260-123440-0006 OURONETER IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED IN THE NIGHT
260-123440-0007 I ALMOST THINK I CAN REMEMBER FEELING A LITTLE DIFFERENT
260-123440-0008 I'LL TRY IF I KNOW ALL THE THINGS I USED TO KNOW
260-123440-0009 I SHALL NEVER GET A TWENTY AT THAT RIGHT
260-123440-0010 HOW CHEERFULLY HE SEEMS TO GRIN HOW NEATLY SPREAD HIS CAS AND WELCOME LITTLE FISHES IN WITH GENTLY SMILING JAWS
260-123440-0011 NO I'VE MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT IT IF I'M MABEL I'LL STAY DOWN HERE
260-123440-0012 IT'LL BE NO USE THEIR PUTTING THEIR HEADS DOWN AND SAYING COME UP AGAIN DEAR
260-123440-0013 I'M SO VERY TIRED BEING ALL ALONE HERE
260-123440-0014 AND I DECLERE IT'S TOO BAB THAT IT IS
260-123440-0015 I WISH SH I HADN'T CRIED SO MUCH SAID ALICE AS SHE SWIM ABOUT TRYING TO FIND HER WAY OUT
260-123440-0016 I SHALL BE PUNISHED FOR IT NOW I SUPPOSE BY BEING TROWNED IN MY OWN TEARS
260-123440-0017 THAT WE BE A EQUEER THING FOR TO BE SURE
260-123440-0018 I AM VERY TIRE TO SWIMMING ABOUT HERE OH MASE
260-123440-0019 CRIED ALICE AGAIN FOR THIS TIME THE MOUSE WAS BRISTLING ALL OVER AND SHE FELT CERTAIN IT MUST BE REALLY OFFENDED
260-123440-0020 WE WON'T TALK ABOUT HER ANY MORE IF YOU'D RATHER NOT WE INDEED
2830-3979-0000 WE WANT YOU TO HELP US PUBLISH SOME LEADING WORK OF LUTHERS FOR THE GENERAL AMERICAN MARKET WILL YOU DO IT
2830-3979-0001 THE CONDITION IS THAT I WILL BE PERMITTED TO MAKE LUTHER TALK AMERICAN STREAM LINE HIM SO TO SPEAK BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER GET PEOPLE WHETHER IN OR OUTSIDE THE LUTHER AND CHURCH ACTUALLY TO READ LUTHER UNLESS WE MAKE HIM TALK AS HE WOULD TALK TO DAY TO AMERICANS
2830-3979-0002 LET US BEGIN WITH THAT HIS COMMENTARY UNGULATIONS
2830-3979-0003 THE UNDERTAKING WHICH SEEMED SO ATTRACTIVE WHEN VIEWED AS A LITERARY TASK PROVED THE MOST DIFFICULT ONE AND AT TIMES BECAME OPPRESSIVE
2830-3979-0004 THERE WAS FRITTEN IN LATIN
2830-3979-0005 THE WARK HAD TO BE CONDINC'D
2830-3979-0006 A WORD SHOULD NOW BE SAID ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF LUTHER'S COMMONARY ANGLEATIONS
2830-3979-0007 MUCH LATER WHEN A FRIEND OF HIS WAS PREPARING IN ADDITION OF ALL HIS LATIN WORKS HE REMARKED TO HIS HOME CIRCLE IF I HAD MY WAY ABOUT IT THEY WOULD REPUBLISH ONLY THOSE OF MY BOOKS WHICH HAVE DOCTRINE MY GLATIONS FOR INSTANCE AND
2830-3979-0008 IN OTHER WORDS THESE THREE MEN TOOK DOWN THE LECTURES WHICH LUTHER ADDRESSED TOSTUDANCE IN THE COURSE OF GLATIONS AND ROAR PREPARED THE MANUSCRIPT FOR THE PRINTER
2830-3979-0009 IT PRESENTS LIKE NO OTHER OF LUTHER'S WRITINGS THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF CHRISTIANITY THE JESTTIFICATION OF THE SINNER FOR THE SAKE OF CHRIST MERITS ALONE
2830-3979-0010 BUT THE ESSENCE OF LOLUTHERIS LECTURES IS THERE
2830-3979-0011 THE LORD WHO HAS GIVEN US POWER TO TEACH AND TO HEAR LET HIM ALSO GIVE US THE POWER TO SERVE AND TO DO LOOT TOO
2830-3979-0012 THE WORD OF OUR GOD SHALL STAND FOREVER
2830-3980-0000 IN EVERY WAY THEY SOUGHT TO UNDERMIND THE AUTHORITY OF SAINT PAUL
2830-3980-0001 THEY SAID TO THE GLATIONS YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO THINK HLY OF PAW
2830-3980-0002 HE WAS THE LAST TO TURN TOCRIST
2830-3980-0003 PALK LATER AND HIS BENEATH US
2830-3980-0004 INDEED HE PERSECUTED THE CHURCH OF CHRIST FOR A LONG TIME
2830-3980-0005 DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT GOD FOR THE SAKE OF A FEWLUTHER IN HERETICS WOULD DISOWONE HIS ENTIRE CHURCH
2830-3980-0006 AGAINST THESE BOASTING FALSEOPOSTILS POUL BOLDLY DEFENENCE HIS APPOSTOLIC AUTHORITY IN MINISTRY
2830-3980-0007 AS THE AMBASSADOR OF A GOVERNMENT IS HONORED FOR HIS OFFICE AND NOT FOR HIS PRIVATE PERSON SO THE MINISTER OF CHRIST SHOULD EXALT HIS OFFICE IN ORDERS AGAIN AUTHORTITYY AMONG MEN
2830-3980-0008 PALTICS PRIDE HIS MINISTRY NOT TO HIS OWN PRAISE BUT TO THE PRAISE OF GOD
2830-3980-0009 PAUL AND APOSTIL NOT OF MEN ET CETERA
2830-3980-0010 EITHER HE CALLUS MINISTERS THROUGH THE AGENCY OF MEN OR HE CALLUSED THEM DIRECTLY AS HE CALLED THE PROPHITS IN A IMPOSTLES
2830-3980-0011 PAWED DECLARES THAT THE FALSEIPOSTELS WERE CALLED THEIR SCENT NEITHER BY MEN NOR BY MAN
2830-3980-0012 THE MOST THEY COULD CLAIM IS THAT THEY WERE SENT BY OTHERS
2830-3980-0013 HE MENTIONEDS THE APOSTILS FIRST BECAUSE THEY REPOINTED DIRECTLY BY GOD
2830-3980-0014 THE CALL IS NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY
2830-3980-0015 FOR PERSON TO POSSESS KNOWLEDGE IS NOT ENOUGH
2830-3980-0016 IS SPOILS ONE'S BEST WORK
2830-3980-0017 WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN I THOUGHT PAUL WAS MAKING TOO MUCH OF HIS COL
2830-3980-0018 I DID NOT THEN REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MINISTRY
2830-3980-0019 I KNOW NOTHING OF THE DOCTRINE OF FAITH BECAUSE WE WERE TAUGHT SO FUSTRIEN SAIDEAD A CERTAINTY AND NOBODY UNDERSTOOD SPIRITUAL BOASTING
2830-3980-0020 THIS IS NO SENFUL PRIDE IT IS WHOLLY PRIDE
2830-3980-0021 IN GOD THE FATHER WHO RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD
2830-3980-0022 THE CLOS SEEM'S SUPERVLUIS ON FIRST SIGHT
2830-3980-0023 THESE PERVERTS OF THE RRIIGHTCHENESS OF CHRIST RESISTS THE FATHER AND THE SON AND THE WORKS OF THEM BOTH
2830-3980-0024 IN THIS WHOLE OF PISTLE PAUL TREATS OF THE RESURRECTION IN CHRIST
2830-3980-0025 BY HIS RESURCTION CHRIST ONE THE VICTORY OVER LAW SIN FLESH WORLD DEVIL DEATH HELL AND EVERY EVIL
2830-3980-0026 FIRST WHO
2830-3980-0027 AND ALL THE BRETH ROOM WHICH ARE WITH ME
2830-3980-0028 THIS SHOULD GO FAR AND SHUTTING THE MOUSE THE FALSEIVE POSILS
2830-3980-0029 ALTHOUGH THE BRETH WITH ME ARE NOT A POSTILS LIKE MYSELF YET THEY ALL OF ONE MIND WITH ME THINK RIGHT AND TEACHES I DO
2830-3980-0030 THEY DO NOT GO WHERE THE ENEMIES OF THE GOSPEL PREDOMINATE THEY GO WERE THE CHRISTIANS ARE
2830-3980-0031 WY THEN NOT INVADED THE CATHOLIC PROVINCES AND PREACHED THEIR DOCTRINE TO GODLIS PRINCES BISHOPS AND DOCTORS AS WE HAVE DONE BY THE HELP OF GOD
2830-3980-0032 WE LOOK FOR THAT REWARD WHICH I HAVE NOT SEEN NOR EAR HEARD NEITHER HAVE ENTERED INTO THE HEART OF MAN
2830-3980-0033 NOT ALL THE GLATIONS HAD BECOME PERVERTED
2830-3980-0034 THESE MEANS CANNOT BE CONTAMINED
2830-3980-0035 THEY REMAINED DIVINE REGARDLESS OF MEN'S OPINION
2830-3980-0036 WHEREVER THE MEANS OF GRACE ARE FOUND THERE IS THE HOLY CHURCH EVEN THOUGH ANTIE GRAST RENES THERE
2830-3980-0037 SO MUCH FOR THE TITLE OF THE EPISTOL NOW FOLLOWS THE GREETING OF THE APOSTSIL VERSE THREE
2830-3980-0038 GRACE BE TO YOU AND PEACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND FROM OUR LORD ESUS CHRIST
2830-3980-0039 THE TERMS OF GRACE AND PIECE ARE COMMON TERMS WITH PAUL AND ARE NOW PRETTY WELL UNDERSTOOD
2830-3980-0040 THE GREETING OF THE APOSTELS REFRESHING
2830-3980-0041 GRACE ANDVOLVES THE REMISSION OF SINDS PEACE AND A HAPPY CONSCIENCE
2830-3980-0042 THE WORLD BRANDS THIS APERNICIOUS DOCTRRINE
2830-3980-0043 EXPERIENCE PROVES THIS
2830-3980-0044 HOWEVER THE GRACE AND PIECE OF GOD WILL
2830-3980-0045 MEN SHOULD NOT SPECULATE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
2830-3980-0046 WAS IT NO NOT ENOUGH TO SAY FROM GOD THE FATHER
2830-3980-0047 TO DO SO AS TO LOSE GOD ALTOGETHER BECAUSE GOD BECOMES INTOLERABLE WHEN WE SEEK TO MEASURE TO COMPREHEND HIS INFINITE MAJESTY
2830-3980-0048 HE CAME DOWN TO EARTH LIVED AMONG MEN SUFFERED WAS CRUCIFIED AND THEN HE DIED STANDING CLEARLY BEFORE US SO THAT OUR HEARTS AND EYES MAY FASTEN UPON HIM
2830-3980-0049 EMBRACE HIM AND FORGET ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
2830-3980-0050 DID NOT CHRIST HIMSELF SAY I AM THE WAY IN THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE NO MAN COMETH UNTO THE FATHER BUT BY ME
2830-3980-0051 WHEN YOU ARE YOU ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD APART FROM THE QUESTION OF JUSTIFICATION YOU MAY BE AS PROFOUND AS YOU LIKE
2830-3980-0052 WE ARE TO HEAR CHRIST TO HAS BEEN APPOINTED BY THE FATHER AS OUR DIVINE TEACHER
2830-3980-0053 AT THE SAME TIME PUL CONFIRMS ARE CREAT THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD
2830-3980-0054 THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD IS APPARENT IN THAT PAUL ASCRIBES TO HIM DIVINE POWERS EQUALLY WITH THE FATHER AS FOR INSTANCE THE POWER TO THE SPENSE GRACE AND PEACE
2830-3980-0055 TO BE STOW PEACE AND GRACE LIES IN THE PROVINCE OF GOD WHO ALONE CON CREATE THESE BLESSINGS THE ANGELS CANNOT
2830-3980-0056 OTHERWISE PAS SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN GRACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND PIECE FROM MY LORD JESUS CHRIST
2830-3980-0057 THE AREIANS TOOK CHRICE FOR A NOBLE IMPERFECT REEATURE SUPERIOR EVEN TO THE ANGELS BECAUSE BY HIM GOD CREATED HEAVEN AND EARTH
2830-3980-0058 MOHAMM IT ALSO SPEAK HLY OF CHRIST
2830-3980-0059 POSICS TO HIS THEMM
2830-3980-0060 HE NEVER LOS HIS SIGHT OF THE PURPOSE OF HIS A PISTLE
2830-3980-0061 NOT GOLD THEIR SILVER OR PASSAL LAMBS OR AN ANGEL BUT HIMSELF WHAT FOR
2830-3980-0062 NOT FOR A CROWN OR KINGDOM OR OUR GOODNESS BEFORE SINS
2830-3980-0063 UNDERSCORE THESE WORDS FOR THEY ARE FULL OF COMFORT FOR SAR CONSCIENCES
2830-3980-0064 HOW MA WE OBTAIN REM MISSSION OF OUR SINS
2830-3980-0065 POLY ANSERS THE MAN WHO IS NAMED JESUS CHRIST AND THE SON OF GOD GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINCE
2830-3980-0066 SINCE CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS IT STANDS TO REASON THAT THEY COULDNOT BE PUT AWAY BY OUR OWN EFFORTS
2830-3980-0067 THIS SENTS ALSO TO FINDS OUR SINS AS GREAT SO GREAT IN FACT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD COULD NOT MAKE AMENDS FOR A SINGLE SEN
2830-3980-0068 THE GREATNESS OF THE RANSOM CHRIST THE SOME OF GOD INDICATES THIS
2830-3980-0069 THE VICIOUS CHARACTER OF SINNE IS BROUGHT OUT BY THE WORDS WHO GAVE HIMSELF FOR A SINCE
2830-3980-0070 BUT WE ARE CARELESS WE MAKE LIGHTE OF SIN
2830-3980-0071 WE THINK THAT BY SOME LITTLE WORK OR MERIT WEAK CAN DISMISSON
2830-3980-0072 THIS PASSAGE THEN THERE IS OUT THE FACT THAT ALL MANN OR SOLDEN D SIN
2830-3980-0073 THIS ATTITUDE SPRING FROM A FALSE CONCEPTION OF SIN THE CONCEPTION AS SAN AS A SMALL MATTER EASILY TAKEN CARE OF BY GOOD WORKS THAT WE MUST PRESENT OURSELVES ON TO GOD WITH A GOOD CONSCIENCE THAT WE MUST FEEL NO SIN BEFORE WE MAY FEEL THAT CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS
2830-3980-0074 THIS ATTITUDE IS UNIVERSAL AND PARTICUARLY DEVELOPED IN THOSE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES BETTER THAN OTHERS
2830-3980-0075 BUT THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE AND COMFORT OF THE WORDS FOR OUR SINS IS LOST UPON THEM
2830-3980-0076 ON THE OTHER HAND WE ARE NOT TO REGARD THEM AND SO TERRIBLE THAT WE MUST DESPAIR
2961-960-0000 HE PASSES ABRUPTLY FROM PERSONS THE IDEAS AND NUMBERS AND FROM IDEAS AND NUMBERS TO PERSONS FROM THE HEAVENS TO MAN FROM A TRONOMY TO PHYSIOLOGY HE CONFUSES OR RATHER DOES NOT DISTINGUISH SUBJECT AND OBJECT FIRST AND FINAL CAUSES AND IS DREAMING OF GEUMETRICAL FIGURES LOST IN A FLIS OF SINSE
2961-960-0001 THE INFLUENCE WHICH THE TO ME US HAS EXERCISE UPON PO MYSTERITY IS DUE PARTLY YOU A MISUNDERSTANDING
2961-960-0002 IN THIS SUPPOSED DEPTHS OF THIS DIAAL THE NEAL PLATINISTS FOUND HIDDEN MEANINGS AND CONNEXIONS WITH THE JEWISH AND CHRISTIAN SKCRIPTURES AND OUT OF THEM THEY IELICITED DOCTRINES QUIET AT VARIANCE WITH THE SPIRIT OF PLTO
2961-960-0003 THEY WERE ABSORBED IN HIS THEOLOGY AND WERE UNDER THE DOMINION OF HIS NAME WHILE THAT WHICH WAS TRULY GREAT AND TRULY CORRECTUISTIC IN HIM HIS EFFORT TO REALIZE IN CONNECT OBSTRCTIONS WAS NOT UNDERSTOOD BY THEM AT ALL
2961-960-0004 THERE IS NO A DANGER OF THE MODERN COMON TEATRURES UNDERTOTNEIUS FALLING AND J THEY ABSURDITIES OF THE NEO PLATNISTS
2961-960-0005 IN THE PRESENT DAY WE ARE WELL A WEAR THAT AN CIIONENT PHILOSOPH IS TO BE IN TRIPRETED FROM HIMSELF AND BY THE CONTEMPORARY HISTORYE OF THOUGHT
2961-960-0006 THE FANCIES OF THE MUAL PLATENISTS ARE ONLY INTERESTING TO US BECAUSE THEY EXCIT OF PHASE OF THE HUMAN MIND WHICH PREVYIL WIDLY THE FIRST CENTURIES OF THE CHRISTIAN ER AND IS NOT WHOLLY EXTINCT IN OUR OWN DAY
2961-960-0007 BUT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF PLATAL AND IN SPIRIT THEY ARE OPPOSED TO HIM
2961-960-0008 WE DO NOT KNOW HOW PLATEAL WOULD HAVE ARRANGED HIS OWN DIALCTS OR WHETHER DE THOUGHT OF ARRANGING ANY OF HIM BESIDESITUTLLITIES WHICH HE HAS EXPRESSLY CONNECTED WAS EVER PRESENT TO HIS MIND
2961-960-0009 THE DIALOE IS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH ANIMAL CREATION INCLUDING UNDER THIS TM THE HEAVILY BODIES AND WITH MAN ONLY AS ONE AMONG THE ANIMALS
2961-960-0010 BUT HE HAS NOT AS YET THE FIND THIS INTERMEDIATERITORY WHICH LIES SOMEWHARE BETWEEN MEDICINE AND METHEMATICS AND HE WOULD HAVE FELT THAT THERE WAS AS GREAT AND IMPIETY INRINKING THEURIES OF PHYSIC'S FIRST IN THE ORDER OF KNOWLEDGE AS IN PLACING THE BODY BEFORE THE SOUL
2961-960-0011 WITH HERPLETIS HE ACKNOWLEDGES THE PERPETUURAL FLUX LIKE AN EC SAAGRAUS HE ASSERVED THE PREDOONINENCE OF MINE ALTHOUGH ADMITTING AN ELEMENT OF NECESSITY WHICH REASON IS INCAPABLE OF SUBDUING BY THE PFICARANS HE SUPPOSES THE MYSTERY OF THE WORLD TO BE CONTAINED IN NUMBER
2961-960-0012 MANY IF NOT ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THE PRESAL CREDIC PHILOSOPHY ARE INCLUDED IN THETEIMUS
2961-960-0013 IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE RELATION OF THE IDEAS TO GOD OR OF GOD TO THE WORLD WAS DIFFERENTLY CONCEIVED BY HIM AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF HIS LIFE
2961-960-0014 THE IDEAS ALSO REMAIN BUT THEY HAVE BECOME TYPES IN NATURE FORMS OF MEN ANIMMAL BIRTS FCES
2961-960-0015 THE STYLE AND PLN OF THE TO MEEUS DIFFER GREATLY FROM THAT OF ANY OTHER OF THE PLATONIC DIALS
2961-960-0016 BUT PLTO HAS NOT THE SAME MESTERY OVER HIS INSTRUMENT WHICH HE EXHIBITS IN THE FEATURES OR SU IMPOSE HIM
2961-960-0017 NOTHING CAN EXCEED THE BEAUTY WERERT OF INTRODUCTION IN WHICH HIS USING WORDS AFTER HIS ACCUSTOMED MANNER
2961-960-0018 BUT IN THE REST OF THE WORK THE POWER OF LANGUAGE SEEMS TO FAIL HIM AND THE DRAMATIC FORM IS WHOLLLY GIVEN UP
2961-960-0019 HE COULD WRIIGHT IN ONE STYLE BUT NOT IN ANOTHER THE GREEQ LANGUAGE HAD NOT AS YET BEEN FASHIONED BY ANY POIT OR PHILOSOPHER TO DESCRIBE PHYSICAL PHENOMENA
2961-960-0020 AND HENCE WE FIND THE SAME SORT OF CLUMSINESS THE TOMAS OF PTO WHICH CHARACTERIZES TO PHILSOPHICAL POORM OF LUCRETIOUS
2961-960-0021 THERE IS A ONE OF FLOW AND OFTEN A DEFECT OF RHYTHM THE MEANING IS SOMETIMES OF SCURE AND THERE IS A GREATER USE OF AP POPOSITION AND MORE OF REPETITION THAN OCCURS AND PLATOS EARLIER WRITANCE
2961-960-0022 PLATEL HAD NOT THE COMMAND OF HIS MATERIALS WHICH WOULD HAVE ENABLED HIM TO PRODUCE OF PERFECT WORK OF OUR
2961-961-0000 SORIEDIES BEGINS TO TOEUS WITH A SUMMARY OF THE REPUBLIC
2961-961-0001 AND NOW HE DESIRES TO SEE THE IDEAL STATE SET IN MOTION HE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW SHE BEHAVED IN SOME GREAT STRUGGLE
2961-961-0002 AND THEREFORE TO YOU I TURN TO ME AS CITIZEN OF LACUS WHO ARE AT ONCE A PHILOSOPHER AND A STATESMAN AND TO YOU CRITTEOUS WHO ALL OTHENIS KNOW TO BE SIMULARLY ACCOMPLISHED AND TO HER MOKRAITIESSE ALSO FITTED BY NATURE AND EDUCATION TO SHARE IN OUR DISCOURSE
2961-961-0003 I WILL IF TO ME AS A PROOVES I APOF
2961-961-0004 LISTEN THEN SO CRTIES TO A TALE OF SOLIENS WHO BEING THE FRIEND OF DROGUIDUS MY GREAT GRANDFATHER TOLD IT TO MY GRANDFATHER CRURITEUS AND HE TOLD ME
2961-961-0005 SOME POEMS OF SOLEN WERE RECITED BY THE BOICE
2961-961-0006 AND WHAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE POO SAID THE PERSON WILL MADE THE REMARK
2961-961-0007 THE SUBJECT WAS A VERY NOBLE ONE HAD DESCRIBE THE MOST FAMOUS ACTION IN WHICH THE AFPTHINIAN PEOPLE WEREEVER ENGAGED
2961-961-0008 BUT THE MEMORY OF THEIR EXPLOITS HAD PASSED AWAY OWING TO THE LAPSE OF TIME AND THE EXTINCTION OF THE EXORRESS
2961-961-0009 TELL US SAID THE OTHER THE WHOLE STORY AND WHERE SOLEEN HER THE STORY
2961-961-0010 BUT IN EACHYPT THE TRADITIONS OF OUR OWN AND OTHER LANDS ARE BY US REGISTRATE FOREVER IN OUR TEMPLES
2961-961-0011 THE GENEOLOGIES WHICH ARE HAVE RECITATE US OUT OF YOUR OWN ANAL SOLUMN ARE AM YOURURE CHILDREN' STORY
2961-961-0012 FOR IN THE TIMES BEFORE A GREAT FLOOD ATHINGS WAS THE GREATEST AND BEST OF CITIES AND DEAD THE NOBLEST DEEDS AND HAD THE BEST CONSTITUTION OF ANY UNDER DE FACE OF HEAVEN
2961-961-0013 SOLEMN MARVELLED AND DESIRED TO BE IN FORMED OF THE PARTICULAR
2961-961-0014 NINE THOUSAND YEARS HAVE HE LAUGSED SINCE SHE FOUNDED YOURS AN EIGHT THOUSAND SINCE SHE FOUNDED OURS AS OUR ANALS RECORD
2961-961-0015 MANY LAWS EXIST A ALLUS WHICH ARE THE COUNTER PART OF YOURS AS THEY WERE IN THE OLDEN TIME
2961-961-0016 I WILL BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THEM TO YOU AND IT SHALL READ THE ACCOUNT OF THEM AT YOUR LEISURE IN THE SACRET RAGISTERS
2961-961-0017 OBSERVE AGAIN WHAT CURED A LO TUKUE THE PURSUIT OF WISDOM SEARCHING OUT THE DEEP THINGS OF THE WORLD AND APPLYING THEM TO THE USE OF MEN
2961-961-0018 THE MOST FAMEES OF THEM ALL WAS THE OVERTHRWOW OF THE ISLAND OF A TLANTIC
2961-961-0019 FOR AT THE PERIL OF HER OWN EXISTENCE AND WHEN THE O TTER HEALINGS HAD DESERTED HER SHE REPELLEDINGVDER AND OF HER OWN ACCORD GAVE LIBERTY TO ALL THE NATIONS WITHINPILLARS
2961-961-0020 THIS IS THE EXPLANATION OF THE SHALLOWS WHICH I FOUND IN THAT PART OF THE ATPLENTIC OCEAN
2961-961-0021 BUT I WOULD NOT SPEAK AT A TIME BECAUSE I WANTED TO REFRESH MY MEMORY
2961-961-0022 THEN THOU LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU THE ORDER OF OUR ENTERTAINMENT FIRST TO ME AS WHOSE A NATURAL PHILOSOPHER WILL SPEAK OF THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD GOING DOWN TO THE CREATION OF MEN AND THEN I SHALL RECEIVE THE MEN WHOM HE HAS CREATED AND SOME OF WHOM WILL HAVE BEEN EDUCATED BY YOU AND INTRODUCE THEM TO YOU AS THE LOST THE FEDAN CITIZENS OF FROM THE EGYPTIAN RECORD SPOKE
3570-5694-0000 BUT ALREADY AT A POINTED ECONOMICVOLUTION FAR ANDATING THE EMOGINENCE OF THE LADY SPECIALIISED CONSEMPTION OF GOODS AS AN EVIDENCE OF PECUNARY STRENGTH HAD BEGUN TO WORK OUT IN A MOR OR LESSLEBERATE SYSTEM
3570-5694-0001 THE UTILTIVE CONSUMPTION AS AN EVIDENCE OF WEALTH IS TO BE CLASS AS A DERIVATIVE GROWTH
3570-5694-0002 SUCH CONSMPTION AS FALLS TO THE WOMEN IS MERELY INCIDENTAL TO THEIR WORK IT IS A MEANS TO THEIR CONTINUED LABOR AND NOT A CONSUMPTION ERECTED TO THEIR OWN COMFT AND FULLNESS OF LIFE
3570-5694-0003 WITH THE FURTHER ATDVS AND CTURE THIS TO BLUM MAY CHANGE IN SIMPLE CUSTOM OF A MOR OR LESS R REIGOROUS CHARACTER BUT WHAT EVER BE THE THEORATICAL BASIS OF THE DISTINCTION WHICH IS MAINTAINED WHETHERTH BE A TOABU OR A LARGE OF CONVENTIONALITY THE FEATURES OF THE CONVENTIONAL SCHEME OF CONSUMPTION DO NOT CHANGE EASILY
3570-5694-0004 IN THE NATURE OF THINGS LUXURIES AND THE COMFITS OF LIFE BELONGED TO THE LEGURE CLASS
3570-5694-0005 UNDER THE TABU SAID IN VICTUALS AND MOPETIC CLEARLY CERTAIN BEVERAGES ARE STRICTLY RESERVED FOR THE USE OF THE SUPERI CLOSS
3570-5694-0006 DRANKENNESSS AND THE OTHER PTHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE FREE YES OF STEMULENCE THEY HAVE ATTEND IN THEIR TURN TO BECOME HO UNDERRIFIC AS BEING AMCH AT THE SECOND REMOVE OF THE SUPERID STATEUS OF THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO AFFORD THE INDULGENCE
3570-5694-0007 IT HAS EVEN HAPPENED THAT THE NAME FOR CERTAIN DISEASED CONDITIONS OF THE BUDDY ARISING FROM SUCH AN A ORIGIN HAS PASSED INTO EVERYDA'S SPEECH AS A SYINONEUM FOR NOBLE OR GENTLE
3570-5694-0008 THE CONSUMPTION OF LUXURIES IN THE TRUCSE HIS A CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THE COMFITCT OF THE CONSUMER HIMSELF AND IS THEREFORE A MARK OF THE MOSTER
3570-5694-0009 WITH MANY QUALIFICATIONS WITH MORE QUALIFICATIONS AS THE PATRICHAL TRADITION HAS GRADUAL WEEAKENED THE GENERAL RU IS FELL TO BE WRIT AND BINDING THAT WOMEN SHOULD CON SEEM ONLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEIR MOSTERS
3570-5694-0010 THE OBJECTION OF COSE PRESENTS ITSELF THAT EXPENDITURE ON WOMEN'S DRESS AND HOUSEHOL PFNALIA IS AN OBVIOUS EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE BUT IT WILL APPEAR IN THE SEQUELT THAT THIS EXCEPTION IS MUCH MORE OBVIOUS AND SUBSTENTIAL
3570-5694-0011 THE CUSTOM OF FESTIVE GATHERINGS PROBABLY ORIGINATED IN MOTIVES OF COMBIALITY AND RELIGION THESE MOTIVES ARELSO PRESENT IN THE LATEED DEVELOPMENT THAT THEY DO NOT CONTINU IT TO BE THE SOLE MOTIVES
3570-5694-0012 THERE IS A MOR OR LESS E LEBERATE SYSTEM OF RANKING GRATES
3570-5694-0013 THIS DEFRNENTIATION IS FURTHERD BY THE INHERITANCE OF WEALTH AND THE CONSEQUENT INHERITANCE OF GENTILITY
3570-5694-0014 MANY OF THESE OF FILIAD DID GENTLEMEN OF LEISURE ARE AT THE SAME TIMELESSMEN OF SUBSTANCE IN THEIR OWN RIGHT SO THAT SOME OF THEM A SCARCE LITTLEAL OTHERS ONLY POSTHLY TO BE WRITED AS BY CARRIIOUS CONSUMUS
3570-5694-0015 SO MANY OF THEM HOWEVER AS MAKE UP THE RETAINER AND HANGSON OF THE PATRON MAY BE CAUSED AS VIYCHARIOUS CONSUMUR WITHOUT QUALIFICATION
3570-5694-0016 MANY OF THESE AGAIN AND ALSO MANY OF THE OTHER ASTROCRACY OF LELESS DEGREE HAVING TURN ATTACHED TO THE PERSONS A MO OR LESS COMPREHENSIVE GROUP OF KA' CONSUMA IN THE PERSONS OF THEIR WIFS AND CHILDREN THEIR SERVANTS RETAINERS ET CETERA
3570-5694-0017 THE WEARING OF UNIFORMS OF LIVERIES IMPLIES A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF DEPENDENCE AND MAY BE SAID TO BE A MARK OF SERVITUDE REAL ORISTENSIBLE
3570-5694-0018 THE WARERS OF UNIFORMS AND LIVERIES MAY BE REOUGHLY DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES THE FREE AND THE SURVILE OR THE NOBLE AND THE IGNLE
3570-5694-0019 BUT THE GERAL DISTINCTION IS NOT ENT ACCOUNT TO BE OVERLOOKED
3570-5694-0020 SO THOSE OFHY ASES WHICH ARE BY RIGHT THE PREPAR EMPLOYMENT OF THE LEGURE CLASS A NOBLE SUCH AS GOVERNMENT FIGHTING HUNTING THE CARE OF ARMS AND ACQUTRMENTS AND THE LIKE IN SHORT THOSE WHICH MAY BE CLASS AS OSTENSIVELY PREETATARY EMPLOYMENTS
3570-5694-0021 WHENEVER AS IN THESE CASES THE MENIAL SERVIC IN QUESTION HAS TO TO DIRECTLY WITH A PRIME RE LEISURE EMPLOYMENTS OF FIGHTING AND HUNTING IT EASILY ACQUIISE A REFLECTED ONAR AFIC CHARACTER
3570-5694-0022 THE LIVERY BECOMES OBNOXIOUS TO EAALLY ALL WHO ARE REQUIRED TO WEAR IT
3570-5695-0000 IN A GENERAL WAY THOUGHO NOT TOLLY NOR CONSISTENTLY THESE TWO GROUPS COIN SIGHT
3570-5695-0001 THE DEPENDENT TO US FIRST DELEGATED FOR THESE DUTIES WAS THE WIFE OR THE CHIEF WIFE AND AS WOULD BE EXPECTED IN A LATED DELOPMENT OF THE INSTITUTION WHEN THE NUMBER OF PERSONS BY WHOM THESE DUTIES ACUSTOMMARILY PERFORMED GRADU A NARROWS THE WIFE REMAINS THELUST
3570-5695-0002 BUT AS WE DESCEND THE SOCIAL SCALE THE POINT IS PRESENTLY REACHED WHERE THE DUTIES OFYCHARA'AS LEISURE AND CONSUMPTION ALLVE UPON ON THE WIFE ALONE
3570-5695-0003 IN THE COMMUNITIES OF THE WESTON CULTURE THIS POINT AS AT PRESENT FOUND AMONG THE LOWER MIDA CLOSS
3570-5695-0004 IF BEAUTYRE COMFIT IS ACHIEVED AND IT IS MORA LESS FORTUE TO CIRCUMSTANS IF THERE THEY MUST BECHIEVED BY MEANS AND METHODS THAT COMMEND THEMSELVES TO THE GREAT ECONOMIC LAW AVOCED EFFORT
3570-5695-0005 THE MAN OF THE HOUSEHOLD ALSO CAN DO SOMETHING IN THISTERICS AND INDEED HE COMMONLY DOES BUT WITH A STILL LOWER DESCEND INTO THE LEVELS OF INDIGENCE ALONG THE MARGIN OF THE SLIMS THE MAN AND PRESENTLY ALSO THE CHILDREN VIRTUALLY SEIZED TO CONSUME VALUABLE GOODS FOR APPEARANCES AND THE WOMAN REMAINS VIRTUALLY THE SOLE EXPONENT OF THE HOUSEHOLDS PECUNARY DECENCY
3570-5695-0006 VERY MUCH OF SQUALTER AND DISCOMFIT WILL BE ENDEED BEFORE THE LAST DRINKET OR THE LAST PRETENENCE OF THEE CUNARY DECENCIES PUT AWAY
3570-5695-0007 THERE IS NO CLASS AND NO COUNTRY THAT AS YIELD SO OBDECTLY BEFORE THE PRESSURE OF PHYSICAL WONT AS TO DENY THEMSELVES ALL GRATIFICATION OF THIS HIGHER OR SPIRITUAL NEED
3570-5695-0008 THE QUESTIONNESS WHICH OF THE TWO METHODS WILL MOST SU EFFECTIVELY REACH THE PERSONS WHOSE CONVICTIONS IT IS DESIRED TO EFFECT
3570-5695-0009 EACH WILL THERE FOR SERVE ABOUT EQUALLY WELL DOING THE EARNEER STAGES OF SOCIAL GROWTH
3570-5695-0010 THE MUDIN ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY WORKS IN THE SAME DIRECTION ALSO VINEE OF LINE
3570-5695-0011 IT IS EVIDENT THEFEL THAT THE PRESENT TREND OF THE DEVELOPMENT IS IN THE ARCTION OF HIGHTENING THE UTILITYIVE CONSBICUIOUS CONSUMPTION AS COMPARED WITH LEISURE
3570-5695-0012 IT IS ALSO NOTICEABLE THAT THE SERV SIBILITIVE CONSUMPTION AS A MEANS OF REPUTE AS WELL AS THE INSISTANCE ON IT AS AN ELEMENT OF DECENCY IS AT ITSST IN THOSE PORTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY WHERE THE HUMAN CONDUCT OF THE INDIVIDUALIES WIDEST AND THE MOBILITY OF THE POPULATION IS GREATEST
3570-5695-0013 CONSUMPTTION BECOMES A LORGE TO ELEMENT IN THE CNARD OF LIVING IN THE CITY THAN IN THE COUNTRY
3570-5695-0014 AMONG THE COUNTRY PUBULATION ITS PLACES TO SOME EXTENTN BY SAVINGS AND HOME COMFORORTS KNOWN THROUGH THE MEDUM OF NEIGHBOURH GOSSICK SUFFICIENTLY TO SERVE THE LIKE GENERAL PAPS OF PECUNARY REPUTE
3570-5695-0015 THE RESULT AS A GREAT MABILITY OF THE LABOUR EMPLOYED IMPRINTING PERHAPS GREATER THAN IN ANY OTHER EQUALLY WELLY FIND AND CONSIDERABLE BUDY OF WORKMEN
3570-5696-0000 UNDER THE SIMPLE TEST OF EFFECTIVENESS FOR ADVERTISING WE SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND LEISURE AND THE CONSPICUOIOUS CONSUMPTION OF GOODS DIVIDING THE FIELD OF PECUNARY AM RELATION PRETTY EVENLY BETWEEN THEM AT THE OUTSET
3570-5696-0001 BUT THE ACTUAL COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THIS IDEAL SCHEME LEISURE HELD THE FIRST PLAZ AT THE START AND CAME TOLL THE RANK FERMA ABOVE WOTEFUL CONCEUMPTION OF GOODS BOTH AS IT DIRECT EXPONENT OF WEALTH AND DO AS AN ELEMENT IN THE STANDARD OF DECENCY DURING THE COSEI PIECEFUL CULTURE
3570-5696-0002 ARE THE CIRCUMSTANCE SU PERMITTING THAT INSTINCT DISPOSES MEN TO LOOK WITH FAVOUR UPON PRODUCTIVEFFICIENCY AND ONALDEVEROUR IS OF HUMANS
3570-5696-0003 A RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE TWO CONFLICTING REQUIIMS IS A EFFEED BY RESORT TO MAKE BELIEVE MEN AND INTRICATE POLITE OBSERVANCES AND SOCIAL DUT TO OF A CEREMONAL NATURE ARE DEVELOPED MANY A ORGANIZATIONS HAVE HOUNDED WITH SOME SPECIOUS OBJECT OF AMILURATION AND BODDED IN THEIR OFFICIAL STYILENT TITLE THERE IS MUCH COMING AND GOING AND A DEAL OF TOKE TO THE END THAT THE TK IS MAY NOT TVOICATION TO REFLECT ON WHAT IS THE EFFECTUIAL ECONOMIC VALUE OF THEIR TRAFFIC
3570-5696-0004 THE SAIL AND FEATURES OF THIS DEVELOPMENT OF DOMESTIC SERVICE HAVE ALREYIN INDICATED
3570-5696-0005 THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE EOLUTION OF CONSBICIOUS EXPENDITURE WHETHER OF GOOD SOR OF SERVICES OR HUMAN LIFE RUNS THE OBVIOUS IMPLICATION THAT IN ORDER TO EFFECTUALLY MEN THE CONSUMEUS GOOD FAME IT MUST BE BEEN EXPENDITURE OF SUPERFLUITIES
3570-5696-0006 AS USED IN THE SPEECH OF EVERYDAY LIFE THE WORD CARESON UNDER TONE OF DEPRECATION
3570-5696-0007 THE YEWS OF THE WORD WASTE AS A TECHNICLE TERM THEREFORE IMPRISE NO DEPRECATION OF THE MOTIVES OR OF THE ENDS SOUGHT BY THE CONSTTUMUR UNDER THIS CANNON OFOUGH CONSBICUOUS WASTE
3570-5696-0008 BUT IT IS ANOTHER GROS WORTH NOTING THAT THE TONG WASTE IN THE LANGUAGE OF EVER DAYY LIFE IMPLIESED THEIRPCATION OF WHAT IS CHARACTERIZ AS WASTEFUL
3570-5696-0009 IN STRICTED ACCURACY NOTHING SHOULD BE INCLUDED UNDER THE HEAD OF CONSPICOUS WAST BUT SUCH EXPENDITURE AS IS INCOURRED ON THE GROUND OF AN INVIDUIOUS PECUNARY COMPARISON
3570-5696-0010 AND OUGHTICA MAY BE USEFUL AND WASISTTEFUL BOTH AND ITSE TILITYED TO THE CONSIEER MAY BE MADE UP OF USE AND WASTE IN THE MOST VAERRYING PROPORTIONS
3575-170457-0000 AND OFTEN HAS MY MOTHER SAID WHILE ON HER LAP I LAID MY HEAD SHE FEARED FOR TIME I WAS NOT MADE BUT F ETERNITY
3575-170457-0001 WHERE WE TO BE DENIETED EACH OTHER SOCIETY
3575-170457-0002 WHY WE TO BE DIVIDED
3575-170457-0003 SURELY IT MUST BE BECAUSE WE IN DANGER OF LOVING EACH OTHER TOO WELL OF LOSING SIGHT OF THE CREATOR AND IDLTRY OF THE CREATURE
3575-170457-0004 WE US TO DISPUTE ABOUT POICS AND RELIGION
3575-170457-0005 SHEATORIAN CLERGYMAN'S DAUGHTER WAS ALWAYS IN A MINORITY OF ONE IN HER HOUSE OF VIOLENT DESCENT IN RADICALISM
3575-170457-0006 HER FEUEBLE HEALTH GAVE HER HER YIELDING MANNER FOR SHE COULD NEVER OPPOSE ANYONE WITHOUT GATHERING UP ALL HER STRENGTH FOR THE STRUGGLE
3575-170457-0007 HE SPOKE FRENCH PERFECTLY I HAVE BEEN TOLD WHEN NEED WAS BUT DELIGHTED USUALLY AND TALKING THE BROADESTYORKSIR
3575-170457-0008 AND SO LIFE AND DEATH HAVE DISPERSED THE CIRCLE VIOLENT RADICALS AND DISSENTORS INTO WHICH TWENTY YEARS AGO THE LITTLE QUIET RESOLUTE CLERGYMAN'S DAUGHTER WAS RECEIVED AND BY WHOM SHE WAS TRULY LOVED AN HONORED
3575-170457-0009 JANUARY AND FEBRUARY OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN HAD PASSED AWAY AND STILL THERE WAS NO REPLY FROM SUDI
3575-170457-0010 I AM NOT DEPPRECIATING IT WHEN I SAY THAT IN THESE TIMES IT IS NOT RARE
3575-170457-0011 BUT IT IS NOT WITH A VIEW TO DISTINCTION THAT YOU SHOULD CULTIVATE THIS TALENT IF YOU CAN SAW YOUR UNHAPPINESS
3575-170457-0012 YOU WILL SAY THAT A WOMAN HAS NO NEED OF SUCH A CAUTION THERE CAN BE NO PERILINATE FOR HER
3575-170457-0013 THE MORE SHE IS ENGAGED IN HER PROPER DUTIES THE LAST LEISURE WILL SHE HAVE FOR IT EVEN AS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT AND A RECREATION
3575-170457-0014 TO THOSE DUTIES YOU HAVE NOT YET BEEN CALLED AND WHEN YOU ARE YOU WILL BE LESS EAGER FOR SOELEBERTY
3575-170457-0015 BUT DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT I DE DISPARAGE THE GIFT WHICH YOU POSSESS NOR THAT I WOULD DISCOURB YOU FROM EXERCISING IT I ONLY EXHORT YOU SO TO THINK OF IT AND SO TO USE IT AS TO RENDER IT CONDUCEIVE TO YOUR OWN PERMANENT GOOD

3575-170457-0036 MY EYES FELL TEARS WHEN I CONTRAST THE BLISS OF SUCH A STATE BRIGHTENED BY HOPES OF THE FUTURE WITH THE MELANCHOCEDATE I NOW LIVN UNCERTAIN THAT I EVER FELT TRUE CONTRITION WONDERING IN IMPLOD INDEED LONGING FOR HOLINESS WHICH I SHALL NEVER NEVER OBTAIN SMISTONING THAT TIMES TO THE HEART WITH THE CONVICTION THAT GHASTLY COVEINISTIC DOCTRINES ARE TRUE DARKENED IN SHORT BY THE VERY SHADOWS A SPIRITUAL DEATH
3575-170457-0037 IF CHRISTIAN PERFECTION BE NECESSARY TO SALVATION I SHALL NEVER BE SAVED MY HEART IS A VERY HOT BED FOR SINFUL THOUGHTS AND WHEN I DECIDE ON A AACTION I SCARCELY REMEMBER TO LOOK TO MY REDEAMMER FOR DIRECTION
3575-170457-0038 AND MEANTIME AND KNOW THE GREATNESS OF JEHOVA I ACKNOWLEDGE THE PERFECTION OF HIS WORD I ADOR THE PURITY OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH MY THEORY IS RIGHT MY PRACTICE HORRIBLY WRONG
3575-170457-0039 THE CHRISMAS HOLIDAYS CAME AND SHE AND ANNE RETURNED TO THE PARSONAGE AND TO THAT HAPPY HOM CIRCLE IN WHICH ALONE THEIR NATURES EXPANDED AMONGST ALL OTHER PEOPLE THEY SHRIVELLED THAT MORE OR LESS
3575-170457-0040 INDEED THERE WERE ONLY ONE OR TWO STRANGERS WHO COULD BE ADMITTED AMONG THE SISTERS WITHOUT PRODUCING THE SAME RESULTS
3575-170457-0041 SHE WAS GONE OUT INTO THE VILLAGE ON SOME ERR AND WHEN AS SHE WAS DESCENDING THE STEEP STREET HER FOOT SLIPPED ON ICE AND SHE FELL IT WAS DARK AND NO SAW HER MI MISS CHANCE TILL AFTER A TIME HER GROANS ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF A PACORB BY
3575-170457-0042 UNFORTUNATELY THE FRACTURE CANNOT BE SET TILL SIX O'CLOCK NEXT MORNING AS NO SURGEON WAS TO BE HAD BEFORE THAT TIME AND SHE NOW LIES AT HER HOUSE IN A VERY DOUBTFUL AND DANGEROUS STATE
3575-170457-0043 HOWEVER REMEMBERING WHAT YOU TOLD ME NAMELY THEY YOU HAD COMMENDED THE MATTER TO A HIGHER DECISION THERS AND THAT YOU RESOLVE TO SUBMIT WITH RESIGNATION TO THAT DECISION WHATEVER MIGHT BE I HOLD THAT MY DUTY TO YIELD ALSO AND TO BE SILENT AND MAY BE ALL FOR THE BEST
3575-170457-0044 AFTER THIS DISAPPOINTMENT I NEVER DARE ROCK IN WITH CERTAINTY ON THE ENJOYMENT OF A PLEASURE AGAIN IT SEEMS AS IF SOME FATALITY STOOD BETWEEN AND ME
3575-170457-0045 I AM NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU AND YOU MUST BE KEPT FROM THE CONTAMINATION OF TWO INTIMATE SOCIETY
3575-170457-0046 A GOOD NEIGHBOUR OF THE BRONTES A CLEVER INTELLIGENT YORKSHER WOMAN WHO KEEPS A DRUGGIST SHOP AND HAWWORTH FROM HER OCCUPATION HER EXPERIENCE IN EXCELLENT SENSE HOLDS THE POSITION OF VILLAGE DOCTRIRESS IN NURSE AND AS SUCH HAS BEEN A FRIEND IN MANY A TIME OF TRIAL AND SICKNESS AND DEATH IN THE HOUSEHOLD ROUND TOLD ME A CHARACTERISTIC LITTLE INCIDENT CONNECTED WITH TABBY'S FCTURED LEG
3575-170457-0047 TABB HAD LIVED WITH THEM FOR TEN OR TWELVE YEARS AND WAS AS CHARLOTE EXPRESSED IT ONE OF THE FAMILY
3575-170457-0048 HE REFUSE AT FIRST TO LISTEN TO THE CAREFUL ADVICE IT WAS REPUGNANT TO HIS LIBERAL NATURE
3575-170457-0049 THIS DECISION WAS COMMUNICATED TO THE GIRLS
3575-170457-0050 TABBY HAD TENDED THEM IN THEIR TILDHOOD THEY AND NONETHER SHE TEND HER IN HER INFIRMITY IN AGE
3575-170457-0051 AT TWO TIME THEY WERE SAD AND SILENT AND THE MEAL WENT AWAY AND TOUCHED BY ANY OF THE THREE
3575-170457-0052 SHE HAD ANOTHER WAY ON HER MIND THIS CHRISTMAS
3575-170457-0053 BUT ANNE HAD BEGUN TO SUEVERIG AS BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS AND CHARLOTTE WATCHED OVER HER YOUNGER SISTERS WITH THE JEALOUS OF VIGILANCE OF SOME WILD CREATURE THAT CHANGES HER VERY NATURE IF DANGER THREATENS HER YOUNG
3575-170457-0054 STUNG BY ANXIETY FOR THIS LITTLE SISTER SHE UPBRATED MISS W FOR HER FANCIED INDIFFERENCE TO ANDNE STAATE OF HEALTH
3575-170457-0055 STILL HER HEART HAD RECEIVED A SHOCK IN THE PERCEPTION OF ANNE'S DELICACY AND ALL THESE HOLIDAY SHE WATCHED OVER HER WITH THE LONGING FONDXIETY WHICH IS SO FULL OF SUDDEN PANGS OF FEAR
3575-170457-0056 I DOUBT W WEHATHER BROWNWELL WAS MAINTAINING HIMSELF AT THIS TIME
3729-6852-0000 TO CELEBRATE THE ARRIVAL OF HER SON SYLVIA GAVE A SPLENDID SUPPER TO WHICH SHE HAD INVITED ALL HER RELATIVES AND IT WAS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO MAKE THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
3729-6852-0001 WITHOUT SAYING IT POSITIVELY SHE MADE ME UNDERSTAND THAT BEING HERSELF AN ILLUSTRIOUS MEMBER OF THE REPUBLIC OF LETTERS SHE WAS WELL AWARE THAT SHE WAS SPEAKING TO AN INSECT
3729-6852-0002 IN ORDER TO PLEASE HER I SPOKE TO HER OF THE ABBEYCANTI AND I HAD OCCASION TO QUOTE TWO LINES OF THAT PROFOUND WRITER
3729-6852-0003 MADAME CORRECTED ME WITH A PATRONIZING AIR FOR MY PRONUNCIATION OF THE WORD SCOVERA WHICH MEANS DIVIDED SAYING THAT IT OUGHT TO BE PRONOUNCED SCUREA AND SHE ADDED THAT I OUGHT TO BE VERY GLAD TO HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH ON THE FIRST DAY OF MY ARRIVAL AND PARIS TELLING ME THAT IT WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT DAY IN MY LIFE
3729-6852-0004 HER FACE WAS IN ANIGMA INSPIRED EVERY ONE WITH THE WARMEST SYMPATHY AND YET IF YOU EXAMIN IT ATTENTIVELY THERE WAS NOT ONE BEAUTIFUL FEATURE SHE COULD NOT BE CALLED HANDSOME BUT NO ONE COULD HAVE THOUGHT HER UGLY
3729-6852-0005 SYLVIA WAS THE ADTERATION OF FRANCE AND HER TALENT WAS THE REAL SUPPORT OF ALL THE COMEDIES WHICH THE GREATEST AUTHORS WROTE FOR HER ESPECIALLY OF THE PLAYS OF MAVOE FOR WITHOUT HER HIS COMODIES WOULD NEVER HAVE GONE TO PROSTTERITY
3729-6852-0006 SYLVIA DID NOT THINK THAT HER GOOD CONDUCT WAS A MERIT FOR SHE KNEW THAT SHE WAS VIRTUOUS ONLY BECAUSE HERSELF LOVE COMPELLED HER TO BE SO AND SHE NEVER EXHIBITED ANY PRIDE OR ASSUMED ANY SU PERIORITY TOWARDS HER THEATRICAL SISTERS ALTHOUGH SATISFIED TO SHINE BY THEIR TALENT OR THEIR BEAUTY THEY CARED LITTLE ABOUT RENDERING THEMSELVES CONSPICUOUS BY THEIR VIRTUE
3729-6852-0007 TWO YEARS BEFORE HER DEATH I SAW HER PERFORM THE CHARACTER OF MARIANNE IN THE COMEDY OF MARAVO AN IN SPITE OF HER AGE AND DECLINING HEALTH THE ILLUSION WAS COMPLETE
3729-6852-0008 SHE WAS HONORABLY BURIED IN THE CHURCH OF SAINT SOVERIR WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST OPPOSITION FROM THE VENERABLE PRIEST WHO FAR FROM SHARING THE ANTI CHRISTIAN INTOLERENCY OF THE CLERGY IN GENERAL SAID THAT HER PROFESSION AS AN ACTRESS HAD NOT HINDERED HER FROM BEING A GOOD CHRISTIAN AND THAT THE EARTH WAS A COMMON MOOTHER OF ALL HUMAN BEINGS AS JESUS CHRIST HAD BEEN THE SAVIOUR OF ALL MANKIND
3729-6852-0009 YOU WILL FORGIVE ME DEAR READER IF I HAVE MADE YOU ATTEND THE FUNERAL OF SYLVIA TEN YEARS BEFORE HER DEATH BELIEVE ME I HAVE NO INTENTION OF PERFORMING A MIRACLE YOU MAY CON SLE YOURSELF WITH THE IDEA THAT I SHALL SPARE YOU THAT UNPLEASANT TASK WHEN POOR SYLVIADIS
3729-6852-0010 I NEVER HAD ANY FAMILY
3729-6852-0011 I HAD AN NAME I BELIEVE IN MY YOUNG DAYS BUT I HAVE FORGOTTEN ITS SCE I HAVE BEEN IN SERVICE
3729-6852-0012 I SHALL CALL YOU A SPREEF

3729-6852-0023 MY REMARK PLEASES HIM BUT I SOON PROVED TO HIM THAT IT DOES NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO SPEAK HOWEVER PERFECT MAY HAVE BEEN THE LANGUAGE OF THAT ANCIENT WRITDER
3729-6852-0024 I SEE A CROWD IN ONE CORNER OF THE GARDEN EVERYBODY STANDING STILL AND LOOKING UP
3729-6852-0025 IS THERE NOT A MARIDI IN EVERYWHERE
3729-6852-0026 YES BUT THE MARIDIAN OF THE PALAISOYAL IS THE MOST EXACT

3729-6852-0033 YOU ARE NOW IN THE ONLY COUNTRYING THE WORLD WHERE WIT CAN MAKE A FORTUNE BY SELLING EITHER A GENUINE OR A FALSE ARTICLE IN THE FIRST CASE IT RECEIVES THE WELCOME OF INTELLIGENT ANDTALENTED PEOPLE AND IN THE SECOND FOOLS ARE ALWAYS READY TO REWARD IT FOR SILLINESS IS TRULY A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PEOPLE HERE AND HOWEVER WONDERFUL IT MAY APPEAR SILLINESS IS THE DAUGHTER OF WIT
3729-6852-0034 LET A MAN RUN AND EVERYBODY WILL RUN AFTER HIM THE CROWD WILL NOT STOP UNLESS THE MAN IS PROVED TO BE MAT BUT TO PROVE IT IS INDEED THE DIFFICULT TASK BECAUSE WE HAVE A CROWD OF MEN WHO MAD FROM THEIR BIRTH ARE STILL CONSIDEREDWISE
3729-6852-0035 IT SEEMS TO ME I REPLIED THAT SUCH APPROVAL SUCH RATIFICATION OF THE OPINION EXPRESSED BY THE KING THE PRINCES OF THE BLOOD ET CETERA IS RATHER APROF OF THE AFFECTION FELT FOR THEM BY THE NATION FOR THE FRENCH CARRY THAT AFFECTION TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THEY BELIEVE THEM AND FLLIBLE
3729-6852-0036 WHEN THE KING COMES TO PARIS EVERYBODY CALLS OUTVVEVIL LOWOY

3729-6852-0038 WHAT SIR I SAID TO HIM AM MY FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO SEE YOU
3729-6852-0039 HE HIMSELF RECIT AT THE SAME PASSAGE IN FRENCH AND POLITELY POINTED OUT THE PARTS IN WHICH HE THOUGHT THAT I HAD IMPROVED ON THE ORIGINAL
3729-6852-0040 FOR THE FIRST DAY SIR I THINK THAT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE GIVES HIS GREAT HOPES OF YOU AND WITHOUT ANY DOUBT YOU WILL MAKE RAPID PROGRESS
3729-6852-0041 I BELIEVE IT SIR AND THAT IS WHAT I FEAR THEREFORE THE PRINCIPAL OBJECT OF MY VISIT HERE IS TO DEVOTE MYSELF ENTIRELY TO THE STUDY OF THE FRENCH LANGUAGE
3729-6852-0042 I AM A VERY UNPLEASANT PUPIL ALWAYS ASKING QUESTIONS CURIOUS TROUBLESOME INSATIAL AND EVEN SUPPOSING THAT I COULDN'T MEET WITH THE TEACHER I REQUIRE I AM AFRAID I AM NOT RICH ENOUGH TO PAY HIM

3729-6852-0044 I WILL MAKE YOU TRANSLATE THEM INTO FRENCH AND YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID OF MY FINDING YOU INSATIABLE
3729-6852-0045 HE HAD A GOOD APPETITE COULD TELL A GOOD STORY WITHOUT LAUGHING WITH CELEBRATED FOR HIS WINDY REBARTES AND HIS SOCIABLE MANNERS BUT HE SPENT HIS LIFE AT HOME SELDOM GOING OUT AND SEEING HARDLY ANYON BECAUSE HE ALWAYS HAD A PIPE IN HIS MOUTH AND WAS SURROUNDED BY AT LEAST TWENTY CATS WITH WHICH HE WOULD AMUSE HIMSELF ALL DAY
3729-6852-0046 HIS HOUSEKEEPER HAD THE MANAGEMENT OF EVERYTHING SHE NEVER ALLOWED HIM TO BE IN NEED OF ANYTHING AND SHE GAVE NO ACCOUNT OF HIS MONEY WHICH SHE KEPT ALTOGETHER BECAUSE HE NEVER ASKED HER TO RENDER ANY ACCOUNTS
4077-13751-0000 ON THE SIXTH OF APRIL EIGHTEEN THIRTY THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER DAY E SAINTS WAS FORMERLY ORGANIZED AND THUS TOOK ON A LEGAL EXISTENCE
4077-13751-0001 ITS ORIGIN WAS SMALL A GERM AN INSIGNIFICANT SEEED HARDLY TO BE THOUGHT OF AS LIKELY TO AROUSE OPPOSITION
4077-13751-0002 INSTEAD OF BUT SIX REGULARLY A FFILIATED MEMBERS AND AT MOST TO SCORE OF ADHERENTS THE ORGANIZATION NUMBERS TO DAY MANY HUNDRED THOUSAND SOULS
4077-13751-0003 IN PLACE HAVE A SINGLE HAMLET IN THE SMALLEST CORNER OF WHICH THE MEMBERS COULD HAVE CONGUGATED THERE NOW ARE ABOUT SEVENTY STAKES OF ZCION AND ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED ORGANIZED WORDS EACH WARD AND STAKE WITH ITS FULL COMPLIMENT OF OFFICERS AND PREESTED ORGANIZATIONS
4077-13751-0004 THE PRACTICE OF GATHERING ITS PROSELITES INTO ONE PLACE PREVENTSED THE BUILDING UP AND STRENGTHENING A FOREIGN BRANCHES AND INASMUCH AS EXTENSIVE AND STRONG ORGANIZATIONS ARE SELDOM MET WITH ABROAD VERY ERRONEOUS IDEAS EXIST CONCERNING THE STRENGTH OF THE CHURCH
4077-13751-0005 NEVERTHELESS THE MUSTERD SEED AMONG THE SMALLEST OF ALL SEEDS HASTAIN THE PROPORTIONS OF A TREE AND THE BIRDS OF THE AIR ARE NESTING IN ITS BRANCHES THE ACORN IS NOW IN OAK OFFERING PROTECTION AND THE SWEETS OF SATISFACTION TO EVERY EARNEST PILGRIM JOURNEYING ITS WAY FIR TRUTH
4077-13751-0006 THEIR EYES WERE FROM THE FIRST TURNED AN ANTICIPATION TOWARD THE EVENING SU NOT MERELY THAT THE WORK OF PROSOLATING SHOULD BE CARRIED ON IN THE WEST BUT TO THE HEAD QUARTERS OF THE CHURCH SHOULD BE THEIR ESTABLISHED
4077-13751-0007 THE BOOKAL MORMMENT HAD TAUGHT THE PEOPLE THE TRUE ORIGIN AND DESTINY OF THE AMERICAN INDIANS AND TOWARD THIS DARK SKINNED REMNANT OF A ONES MIGHTY PEOPLE THE MISSIONARIES OF MORMANISM EARLY TURNED THEIR EYES AND WITH THEIR EYES WENT THEIR HEARTS AND THEIR HOPES
4077-13751-0008 IT IS NOTABLE THAT THE INDIAN TRIBES HAVEJRELY REGARDED THEIR RELIGION OF THE LATTER DAY SAINT WITH FAVOR SEEING IN THE BOOKAL WARMON STRIKING AGREEMENT WITH HER OWN TRADITIONS
4077-13751-0009 THE FIRST WELL ESTABLISHED SEAT OF THE CHURCH WAS IN THE PRETTY LITTLE TOWN OF CURLAND OHIO ALMOST WITHIN SIGHT OF LAKE ERIE AND HERE SOON ROSE THE FIRST TEMPLE OF MODERN TIMES
4077-13751-0010 TO THE FERVENT LATTER DAY SAINT A TEMPLE IS NOT SIMPLY A CHURCH BUILDING A HOUSE F RELIGIOUS ASSEMBLY
4077-13751-0011 SOON THOUSANDS OF CONVERTS HAD RENTED OR PURCHASED HOMES AND MISERY INDEPENDENCE JACKSON COUNTY BEING THEIR CENTER BUT FROM THE FIRST THEY WERE UNPOPULAR AMONG THE MASIRIIANS
4077-13751-0012 THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR LITTLE BURN W BOGX AFTERWARD GOVERNOR WAS A PRONOUNCED MOMAN HATER AND THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD OF THE TROUBLES HE MANIFIC'S SYMPATHY WITH THE PERSECUTORS
4077-13751-0013 THEIR SUFFERINGS HAVE NEVER YET BEEN FITLY CHRONICL BY HUMANSCRIBE
4077-13751-0014 MAKING THEIR WAY ACROSS THE RIVER MOST OF THE REFUGEES FOUND SHELTER AMONG THE MORE HOSPITABLE PEOPLE OF GLAY COUNNY AND AFTERWARD ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES IN CALLED WELLE COUNTY THERE IN FOUNDING THE CITY OF FAR WEST
4077-13751-0015 A SMALL SETTLEMENT HAD BEEN FOUNDED BY WRMAN FAMILIES ON SHAL CREEK AND HERE ON THE THIRTIETH OF OCTOBER EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT A COMPANY OF TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FELL UPON THE HAPLESS SETTLERS AND BUTCHERED A SCORE
4077-13751-0016 BE IT SAID TO THE HONOR OF SOME OF THE OFFICERS ENTRUSTED WITH A TERRIBLE COMMISSION THAT WHEN THEY LEARN ITS TRUE SIGNIFICANCE THEY RESIGN THERE AUTHORITY RATHER THAN HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT THEY DESIGNATED A COLD BLOODED BUTCHERY
4077-13751-0017 OH WHAT A RECORD TO READ WHAT A PICTURE TO GAZE UPON HOW AWFFUL THE FACT
4077-13751-0018 AMERICAN SCHOOLOYS READ WITH EMOTIONS OF HORROR OF THE ALBGENCES DRIVEN BEIDN AND KILLED WITH A PAPAL LEGATE DIRECTING THE BUTCHERY AND OF THEDOIS HUNTED AND HOUNDED LIKE BEASTS AS THE EFFECT OF A ROYAL DETREE AND THEY YET SHALL READ IN THE HISTORY OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY OF SEECENES AS TERRIBLE AS THESE IN THE EXHIBITION OF INJUSTICE AND INHUMAN HATE
4077-13751-0019 WHO BEGAN THE QUARREL WAS AT THE MORMONS
4077-13751-0020 AS THE CABLE OF THE PRESS COMMENTS AGAINST OF THE BRUTALITY OF THE MASIRIANS I QUOTE A PARAGRAPH FROM THE QUINCY ARGUS MARCH SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE
4077-13751-0021 IT WILL BE OBSERVED THAT AN ORGANIZED MOB AIDED BY MANY OF THE CIVIL AND MILITARY OFFICERS OF MISSUURY WITH GOVERNOR BOX AT THEIR HEAD HAVE BEEN THE PROMINENT ACTORS IN THIS BUSINESS INCITED TOO IT APPEARS AGAINST THE MORMONS BY POLITICAL HATRED AND BY THE ADDITIONAL MOTIVES OF PLUNDER AND REVENGE
4077-13754-0000 THE ARMY SOUND THE PEOPLE AND POVERTY AND LEFT HIM IN COMPARATIVE WEALTH
4077-13754-0001 BUT A WORD FURTHER CONCERNING THE EXPEDITION IN GENERAL
4077-13754-0002 IT WAS THROUGH FLOIDS ADVICE THAT BECAME IN ORDER THE MILITARY EXPEDITION TO UTAH HOSTENSIBLY TO INSTLL CERTAIN FEDERAL OFFICIALS AND TO REPRESS AN ALLEGED INFANTILE REBELLION WHICH IN FACT HAD NEVER COME INTO EXISTENCE BUT IN REALITY TO FURTHER THE ENTRANCE OF THE SUSCESSIONISTS
4077-13754-0003 MOREOVERHE HAD THE PEOPLE BEEN INCLINED TO REBELLION WHILE GREATER OPPORTUNITY COULD THEY HAVE WISHED
4077-13754-0004 ALREADY IN NORTH AND A SOUTH WERE TALKED IT OF WHY NOT SAID A ALS A WEST
4077-13754-0005 THEY KNEW NO NORTH NO SOUTH NO EAST NO WEST THEY SOOO POSITIVELY BY THE CONSTITUTION AND WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO IN THE BODY STRIFE BETWEEN BROTHERS UNLESS INDEED THEY WERE SUMMONED BY THE AUTHORITY TO WHICH THEY HAD ALREADY ONCE LOYALLY RESPONDED TO FURNISH MEN AND ARMS FOR THE COUNTRIES NEED
4077-13754-0006 WHAT THE LETTER I SAINTS CASELLUSIAL MARRIAGE HIS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE CHURCH AND IS IN VERY GENERAL PRACTICE BUT OF SOELESTIAL MARRIAGE PLERALITY OF WIVEISE WAS AN INCIDENT NEVER AN ESSENTIAL
4077-13754-0007 WE BELIEVE IN A LITTLEERAL RESURRECTION AND AN ACTUAL HEREAFTER IN WHICH FUTURE STATES SHALL BE RECOGNIZED EVERY SANCTIFIED AUTHORIZE RELATIONSHIP EXISTING HERE UNEARTH OF PARENT AND CHILD BROTHER AND SISTER HUSBAND AND WIFE
4077-13754-0008 IT HAS BEEN MY PRIVILEGE TO TREAD THE SOIL OF MANY LANDS TO OBSERVE THE CUSTOMS AND STUDY THE HABITS OF MORE NATIONS THAN ONE I HAVE YET TO FIND THE PLACE AND ME THE PEOPLE WHEREIN WITH WHOM THE PURITY OF MAN AND WOMAN HAS HELD MORE PRECIOUS THAN AMONG THE MALINED WRMONS IN THE MOUNTAIN VALLEYS OF THE WEST
4077-13754-0009 AT THE INCEPTION OF BORAL MARRIAGE AMONG THE LATTER DAY SINTS THERE WAS NO LAW NATIONAL OR STATE AGAINST ITS PRACTICE
4077-13754-0010 IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO A LAW WAS ANCTY WITH A PURPOSE OF SUPPRESSING BORAL MARRIAGE AND AS HAD BEEN PREDICTED IN THE NATIONAL SENATE PRAYER TO ITS PASSAGE IT LAY FROM MANY YEARS A DEAD LETTER
4077-13754-0011 FEDERAL JUDGES AND UNITED STATES ATTORNES IN UTA WHO ARE NOT MOR MEANNS NOR LOVERS OF WARMANISM REFUSE TO ENTERTAIN COMPLAINTS OR PROSECUTE CASES UNDER THE LAW BECAUSE OF ITS MANIFEST IN JUSTICE AND INADEQUACY
4077-13754-0012 THIS MEANT THAT FOR AN ALLNGCHE MISTDEMEANOUR FOR WHICH CONGRESS PRESCRIBED A MAXIMEN PENALTY OF SIX MONTHS IMPRISONMENT AND A FINE OF THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MAN MIGHT BE IMPRISON FOR LIFE I FOR MANY TERMS OF AM'S NATURAL LIFE DID THE COURT'S POWER TO ENFORCE ITS SENTENCES EXTEND SO FAR AND MIGHT BE FIND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
4077-13754-0013 BEFORE THIS TRAVESTY ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF LAW COULD BE BROUGHT BEFORE THE COURT OF LAST RESORT AND THERE MET WITH THE REVERSAL AND REBUKE IT DESERVED MEN WERE IMPRISONED UNDER SENTENCE OF MANY YEARS DURATION
4077-13754-0014 THE PEOPLE CONTESTED THESE MEASURES ONE BY ONE IN THE COURTS PRESENTING IN CASE AFTER CASE THE DIFFERENT PHASES OF THE SUBJECT AND URGING THE UNCONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE MEASURE
4077-13754-0015 THAN THE CHURCH WAS DISINCOORPORATED AND ITS PROPERT BOTH REAL AND PERSONAL CONFISCATED ANDSIATED TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND ALTHOUGH THE PERSONAL PROPERTY WAS SOON RESTORED REALISTATE OF GREAT VALUE LONG LAY IN THE HANDS OF THE COURTS RECEIVER AND THE WRMON CHURCH HAD TO PAY THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT HIGH RENTAL ON ITS OWN PROPERTY
4077-13754-0016 AND SO THE STORY OF MORMONISM RUNS ON ITS FINAREY HAS NOT YET BEEN WRITTEN THE CERRIENT PRESS PRESENTS CONTINUOUSLY NEW STAGES OF ITS PROGRESS NEW DEVELOPMENTS OF ITS PLAN
4446-2271-0000 MAHALL LIFE ALEXANDER BECAUSE HE WAS AN ENGINEER

4507-16021-0009 WHEN IT IS A QUESTION OF PROBING A WOUND A GOAL A SOCIETY SINCE WHEN HAS IT BEEN CONSIDERED WRONG TO GO TOO FAR TO GO TO THE BOTTOM
4507-16021-0010 WE HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT IT WAS SOMETIMES A COURAGEOUS ACT AND AT LEAST A SIMPLE AND USEFUL DEED WORTHY OF THE SYMPATHETIC ATTENTION WHICH DUTY ACCEPTED IN FULFILLED MERITS
4507-16021-0011 WHY SHOULD ONE NOT EXPLORE EVERYTHING AND STUDY EVERYTHING
4507-16021-0012 WHY SHOULD ONE HALT ON THE WAY
4507-16021-0013 NOTHING IS MORE LUGUBRIOUS THAN THE CONTEMPLATION THUS IN ITS NUDITY IN THE BROAD LIGHT OF THOUGHT OF THE HORRIBLE SWARMING OF SLNG
4507-16021-0014 NOW WHEN HAS HORROR EVER EXCLUDED STUDY
4507-16021-0015 SINCE WHEN HAS MALADY BANISHED MEDICINE
4507-16021-0016 CAN ONE IMAGINE A NATURALIST REFUSING TO STUDY THE VIIPER THE BAT THE SCORPION THE CENTIPEDE THE TRANILLLA AND ONE WHO WOULD CAST THEM BACK INTO THEIR DARKNESS SAYING OH HOW UGLY THAT IS
4507-16021-0017 HE WOULD BE LIKE A PHOLOGIST REFUSING TO EXAMINE A FACT IN LANGUAGE A PHILOSOPHER HESITATING TO SCRTINIZE A FACT IN HUMANITY
4507-16021-0018 WHAT IS SLANG PROPERLY SPEAKING
4507-16021-0019 IT IS THE LANGUAGE OFFRETEDNESS
4507-16021-0020 WE MAY BE STOPPED THE FACT MAY BE PUT TO US IN GENERAL TERMS WHICH IS ONE WAY OF ATTENUATING IT WE MAY BE TOLD THAT ALTERRAATES PROFESSIONS IT MAY BE ADDED ALL THE ACCIDENTS OF THE SOCIAL HIERARCHAN ALL FORMS OF INTELLIGENCE OF THEIR OWN SLNG
4507-16021-0021 THE PAINTER WHO SAYS MY GRINDER THE NOTURY WHO SAYS MY SKIP OF A GUTTER THE HAIR DRESSER WHO SAYS MY MEALLY BACK THE COBBLER WHO SAYS MY CUB TALKS SLANG

4507-16021-0026 TO KEEP AFLOAT AND TO RESCUE FROM OBLIVION TO HOLD ABOVE THE GULF WERE IT BUT A FRAGMENT OF SOME LANGUAGE WHICH MEN HAS SPOKEN AND WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE BE LOST THAT IS TO SAY ONE OF THE ELEMENTS GOOD OR BAD OF WHICH CIVILIZATION IS COMPOSE OR BY WHICH IT IS COMPLICATED TO EXTEND THE RECORDS OF SOCIAL OBSERVATION IS TO SERVE CIVILIZATION ITSELF
4507-16021-0027 PHNICIAN VERY GOOD

4507-16021-0029 TO THIS WE REPLY IN ONE WORD ONLY
4507-16021-0030 ASSUREDLY IF THE TONGUE WHICH A NATION OR A PROVINCE HAS SPOKEN IS WORTHY OF INTEREST THE LANGUAGE WHICH HAS BEEN SPOKEN BY A MISERY IS STILL MORE WORTHY OF ATTENTION AND STUDY
4507-16021-0031 AND THEN WE INSIST UPON IT THE STUDY OF SOCIAL DEFORMITYIES AND INFIRMITIES AND THE TASK OF POINTING THEM OUT WITH THE VIEW TO REMEDY IS NOT A BUSINESS IN WHICH CHOICES PERMITTED
4507-16021-0032 HE MUST DESCEND WITH HIS HEART FULL OF CHARITY AND SEVERITY OF THE SAME TIME AS A BROTHER AND AS A JUDGE TO THOSE IMPENETRABLE CASEMATES WERE CRAWL PLL NOW THOSE WHO BLEED IN THOSE WHO DEAL THE BLOW THOSE WHO WEEP IN THOSE WHO CURSE THOSE WHO FAST IN THOSE WHO DEVOUR THOSE WHO WHO ENDURE EVIL AND THOSE WHO INFLICTED

4507-16021-0037 THEY ARE IT CLOTHES ITSELF IN WORD MASKES IN METIAPHOR RAGS
4507-16021-0038 IN THIS GGUIESE IT BECOMES HORRIBLE
4507-16021-0039 ONE PERCEIVES WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING IT A HIDEOUS MURMUR STUNDING ALMOST LIKE HUMAN ACCENTS BUT MORE NEARLY RESEMBLING A HOWL THAN ANARTICULATE WORD
4507-16021-0040 ONE THINKS ONE HEE'S HIGYHDRESS TALKING

5105-28233-0003 WE DON'T SPEND TOPS IS A FAVORITE SAYING AMONGST ARTILLERY OFFICERS INDICATING THAT THEY DO NOT SHIRK THEIR DUTY BY FRIVOLOUS PURSUITS BUT IT MUST BE CONFESSED THE SERVANT THAT BEING NATURALLY IDLE WAS VERY MUCH GIVEN TO SPINDING TOPS
5105-28233-0004 ONCE IN ACTION HE WAS LEADING A ATTACHMENT OF INFANTRY THROUGH AN ENTRENCHMENT
5105-28233-0005 SOMETIMES WHO WOULD WANDER ON FOOT UPON THE SANDY SHORE AND SOMETIMES HE WOULD ENJOY ARIDE ALONG THE SUMMIT OF THE CLIFF ALTOGETHER BEING IN NO HURRY ATL TO BRING HIS TASK TO AN END
5105-28233-0006 NO CATHEDRAL NOT EVEN BURGOS ITSELF COULD VIE WITH THE CHURCH AT MONTNRTRA
5105-28233-0007 BENZ MOST AMBITIOUS DESIRE WAS TO INDUCE THE CAPTAIN TO GO WITH HIM AND END HIS DAYS IN HIS MUCH LOVED HOME AND SO INCESSANTLY WERE SERVANTAX YEARS BESIEGED WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF THE UNPARLLEL BEAUTIES AND ADVANTAGES OF THIS EIGHTEENTH OURR ONSIMO OF PARIS THAT HE COULD SCARCELY HEAR THE NAME OF MONTMRTRA WITHOUT A CONSCIOUS THRILL OF AVERSION
5105-28233-0008 WHEN A PRIVATE IN THE AIGHTH CAVALRY HE HAD BEEN ON THE POINT OF QUITTING THE ARMY AT TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OF AGE BUT UNEXPECTEDLY HE HAD BEEN APPOINTED ORDERLY TO CAPTAIN SERVDACK
5105-28233-0009 THE BOND OF UNION THUS AFFECTED COULD NEVER BE SEVERED AND ALTHOUGH BNZEPH'S ACHIEVEMENTS HAD FAIRLY EARNED HIM THE RIGHT OF RETIREMENT HE FIRMLY DECLINED ALL HONORS OR ANY PENSION THAT MIGHT PART HIM FROM HIS SUPERIOR OFFICER
5105-28233-0010 A LIKE HIS MASTER HE MADE NO PRETENSION TO ANY GIFT OF POETIC POWER BUT HIS INEXHAUSTIBLE MEMORY MADE HIM A LIVING IN CSYCLAPEIA AND FOR HIS STOCK OF ANECDOTES AND TROOPER'S TALES HE WAS MATCHLESS
5105-28240-0000 FAST AS HIS LEGS COULD CARRY HIM SERVE A DECK HAD MADE HIS WAY TO THE TOP OF THE CLIFF
5105-28240-0001 IT WAS QUITE TRUE THAT A VESSEL WAS IN SIGHT HARDLY MORE THAN SIX MILES FROM THE SHORE BUT OWING TO THE INCREASE IN THE EARTH'S CONVEXITY AND THE CONSEQUENT LIMITATION OF THE RANGE OF VISION THE RIGGING OF THE TOP MASTS ALONE WAS VISIBLE ABOVE THE WATER
5105-28240-0002 EXCLAIMED SERVE ACK KEEPING HIS EYE UNMOVED AT HIS TEELESCOPE
5105-28240-0003 SHE IS UNDER SALE BUT SHE IS COUNT HIM ACHEFT'S YAT HE WAS RIGHT
5105-28240-0004 IF THE COUNT WERE ON BOARD A STRANGE FATALITY WAS BRINGING HIM TO THE PRESENCE OF HIS RIVAL
5105-28240-0005 HE RECKON THEREFORE NOT ONLY UPON ASCERTAINING THE EXTENT OF THE LAKE CATASTROPHE BUT UPON LEARNING ITS CAUSE
5105-28240-0006 THE WIND BEING ADVERSE THE DOGREENA DID NOT MAKE VERY RAPID PROGRESS BUT AS THE WEATHER IN SPITE OF A FEW CLOUDS REMAINED CALM AND THE SEA WAS QUITE SMOOTH SHE WAS ENABLED TO HOLD A STEADY COARSE
5105-28240-0007 SERVIDAT TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT THE DO BRINA WAS ENDEAVORING TO PUT IN
5105-28240-0008 A NARROW CHANNEL FORMED A PASSAGE THROUGH THE RIDGE OF ROCKS THAT PROTECTED IT FROM THE OPEN SEA AND WHICH EVEN IN THE ROUGHEST WEATHER WOULD INSURE THE CALMNESS OF ITS WATERS
5105-28240-0009 SLIGHTLY CHANGING HER COURSE SHE FIRST STRUCK REMAIN SAIL AND IN ORDER OF FACILITATE THE MOVEMENTS OF HER HELMSMAN SOON CARRIED NOTHING BUT HER TWO TOP SAILS BRIGANTINE AND JIBB
5105-28240-0010 CAPTAIN SERVE AA BACK HASTENED TOWARD HIM
5105-28240-0011 I LEFT YOU ON A CONTINENT AND HERE I HAVE THE HONOUR OF FINDING YOU ON AN ISLAND
5105-28240-0012 NEVER MIND NOW INTERPOSE THE CAPTAIN WE WILL TALK OF THAT BY AND BY
5105-28240-0013 NOTHING MORE THAN YOU KNOW YOURSELF
5105-28240-0014 ARE YOU CERTAIN THAT THIS IS THE MEDITERRANEAN
5105-28240-0015 FOR SOME MOMENTS HE SEEMED PERFECTLY STUPEFIED AND THEN RECOVERING HIMSELF HE BEGAN TO OVERWHELMED THE COUNT WITH A TORRENT OF QUESTIONS
5105-28240-0016 TO ALL THESE INQUIRIES THE COUNT RESPONDED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE
5105-28240-0017 SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE SEEMED TO HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT A CONVULSION OF THE ELEMENTS
5105-28240-0018 YOU WILL TAKE ME ON BOARD COUNT WILL YOU NOT
5105-28240-0019 MYD IS AT YOUR SERVICE SIR EVEN SHOULD YOU REQUIRE TO MAKE A TOUR ROUND THE WORLD
5105-28240-0020 THE COUNT SHOOK HIS HEAD
5105-28240-0021 BEFORE STARTING IT WAS INDISPENSABLE THAT THE ENGINE OF THE DOBRINA SHOULD BE REPAIRED TO SAIL UNDER CANVAS ONLY WOULD IN CONTRARY WINDS AND ROUGH SEAS BE BOTH TEDIOUS AND DIFFICULT
5105-28240-0022 IT WAS ON THE LAST DAY OF JANUARY THAT THE REPAIRS OF THE SCHOONER WERE COMPLETED
5105-28240-0023 A SLIGHT DIMINUTION IN THE EXCESSIVELY HIGH TEMPERATURE WHICH HAD PREVAILED FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS WAS THE ONLY APPARENT CHANGE IN THE GENERAL ORDER OF THINGS BUT WHETHER THIS WAS TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO ANY ALTERATION IN THE EARTH'S ORBIT WAS A QUESTION WHICH WOULD STILL REQUIRE SEVERAL DAYS TO DECIDE
5105-28240-0024 DOUBTS NOW AROSE AND SOME DISCUSSION FOLLOWED WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS DESIRABLE FOR BENZO IF TO ACCOMPANY HIS MASTER
5105-28241-0000 HER SEA GOING QUALITIES WERE EXCELLENT AND WOULD HAVE AMPLY SUFFICED FOR A CIRCUM NAVIGATION OF THE COLOBE
5105-28241-0001 AFTER AN APPRENTICESHIP ON A MERCHANTSHIP HE HAD ENTERED THE IMPERIAL NAVY AND HAD ALREADY REACHED THE RANK OF LIEUTENANT WHEN THEC COOUNT APPOINTED HIM TO THE CHARGE OF HIS OWN PRIVATEYT IN WHICH HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO SPEND BY FARTHER GREATER PART OF HIS TIME THROUGHOUT THE WINTER GENERALLY CRUISING IN THE MEDITERRANEAN WHILSTON THE SUMMER HE VISITED MORE NORTHERN WATERS
5105-28241-0002 THE LATE ASTOANUNDING EVENTS HOWEVER HAD RENDERED PROK HOPE MANIFASTLY UNEASY AND NOT THE LESS SO FROM HIS CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THE COUNT SECRETLY PARTOOK OF HIS OWN ANXIETY
5105-28241-0003 STEAM UP AND CANVAS SPREAD THE SCOONER STARTED EASTWARDS
5105-28241-0004 ALTHOUGH ONLY A MODERATE BREEZE WAS BLOWING THE SEA WAS ROUGH A CIRCUMSTANCE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR ONLY BY THE DIMUNUTION IN THE FORCE OF THE EARTH'S ATTRACTION RENDERING THE LIQUID PARICLE SO BUYANT THAT BY THE MERE EFFECT OF OSCILLATION THEY WERE CARRIED TO A HEIGHT THERE WAS QUITE UNPRECEDENTED
5105-28241-0005 FOR A FEW MILES SHE FOLLOWED THE LINE HITHERTO PRESUMABLY OCCUPIED BY THE COAST OF ALJERIA BUT NO LAND APPEARED TO THE SOUTH
5105-28241-0006 THE LOG AND THE COMPASS THEREFORE WERE ABLE TO BE CALLED UPON TO DO THE WORK OF THE SEXTANT WHICH HAD BECOME UTTERLY USELESS
5105-28241-0007 THERE'S NO FEAR OF THAT SIR
5105-28241-0008 OF THE EARTH HAS UNDOUBTEDLY ENTERED UPON A NEW ORBIT BUT SHE IS NOT INCURRING ANY PROBABLE RISK OF BEING PRECIPITATED ON TO THE SUN
5105-28241-0009 AND WHAT DEMONSTRATION DO YOU OFFER ASKED SERVE BACK EAGERLY THAT IT WILL NOT HAPPEN
5105-28241-0010 OCEAN RAIN SUPREME
5105-28241-0011 ALL THE IMAGES OF HIS PAST LIFE FLOATED UPON HIS MEMORY HIS THOUGHTS SPED AWAY TO HIS NATIVE FRANCE ONLY TO RETURN AGAIN TO WONDERH OF THE DEPTHSVOTION WOULD REVEAL ANY TRACES OF THE AUJERIAN METROPOLIS
5105-28241-0012 IS IT NOT IMPOSSIBLE HE MURMURED ALOUD THAT ANY CITY SHOULD DISAPPEAR SO COMPLETELY
5105-28241-0013 WOULD NOT THE LOFTIEST EMINENCES OF THE CITY AT LEAST BE VISIBLE
5105-28241-0014 ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE WAS MOST REMARKABLE
5105-28241-0015 TO THE SURPRISE OF ALL AND ESPECIALLY OF LIEUTENANT PROCOPE THE LINE INDICATED A BOTTOM AT A NEARLY UNIFORMED DEPTH OF FROM FORTIFY FATHOMS AND ALTHOUGH THE SOUNDING WAS PERSEVERED WITH CONTINUOUSLY FOR MORE THAN TWO HOURS OVER A CONSIDERABLE AREA THE DIFFERENCES OF LEVEL WERE INSIGNIFICANT NOT CORRESPONDING IN THE ANY DEGREE TO WHAT WOULD BE EXPECTED OVER THE SIGHT OF A CITY THAT HAD BEEN TERRACS LIKE THE SEATS OF AN AMPHITHATRE
5105-28241-0016 YOU MUST SEE LIEUTENANT I SHOULD THINK THAT WE ARE NOT SO NEAR THE COAST OF ALJRIA AS YOU IMAGINED
5105-28241-0017 AFTER PONDERING A WHILE HE SAID IF WE WERE FARTHER AWAY I SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND A DEPTH OF TWO OR THREE HUNDRED FATHOMS INSTEAD OF FIVE FATHOMS FIVE FATHOMS
5105-28241-0018 ITS DEPTH REMAINED INVARIABLE STILL FOUR OR ATTMOST FIVE FATHOMS AND ALTHOUGH ITS BOTTOM WAS ASIDUOUSLY DREDGED IT WAS ONLY TO PROVE IT BARON OF MARINE PRODUCTION OF ANY TYPE
5105-28241-0019 NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE BUT TO PUT ABOUT AND RETURN AND DISAPPOINTMENT TOWARD THE NORTH

5639-40744-0024 ONE DAY WHEN THE BOY WAS SENT BY HIS GRANDFATHER WITH A MESSAGE TO A RELATION HE PASSEDLONG A STREET INISH THERE WAS A GREAT CONCOURSE OF HORSEMEN
5639-40744-0025 THE BED SHE TOO WELL REMEMBERED WAS THERE AND ABOVE ALL THE CABINET ON WHICH HAD STOOD THE IMAGE SHE HAD TAKEN AWAY WAS STILL ON THE SAME SPOT
5639-40744-0026 LOIS WAS OUT OF DANGER IN A FORTNIGHT IN A MONTH HE ROSE FROM HIS BED AND DWYING ALL THAT TIME HE WAS VISITED DAILY BY HIS MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER AND TREATED BY THE MASTER AND MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE AS IF HE WAS THEIR OWN CHILD
5639-40744-0027 THUS SAYING AND PRESSING THE CRUCIFIXED TO HER BREAST SHE FELL FAINTING INTO THE ARMS OF DONA IS TOPHINIA WHOS A GENTLEWOMAN TO WHOSE SIX PITY IS A NATURAL AS CRUELTY IS TO MAN INSTANTLY PRESSED HER LIPS TO THOSE OF THE FAINTING GIRL SHEDTING OVER HER SO MANY TEARS THAT THEIR NEEDED NO OTHER SPRINKLING OF WATER TO RECOVER LOOCADIA FROM HER SWON
5639-40744-0028 I HAVE QU THINGS TO TELL YOUR SIGNOR SAID DAAR AS TOFYIA TO HER HUSBAND THE CREAMAN SUBSTANCE OF WHICH IS THIS THE FAINTING GIRL BEFORE YOU IS YOUR DAUGHTER AND THE BOY AS YOUR GRANDSON
5639-40744-0029 THIS TRUTH WHICH I HAVE LEARNED FROM HER LIPS IS CONFIROMED BY HIS FACE IN WHICH WE HAVE BOTH BEHELD THAT OF OUR SON
5639-40744-0030 JUST THEN LEOCGIA CAME TO HERSELF AND EMBRACING THE CRROSS SEEM CHANGED INTO A SEA OF TEARS AND THE GENTLEMAN REMAINING IN UTER A WILDERAN UNTIL HIS WIFE HAD REPEATED TO HIM FROM BEGINNING TOIND THEIRCADI'US WHOLE STORY AND HE BELIEVED IT THROUGH THE BLESS A DISPENSATION OF HEAVEN WHICH HAD CONFIRMED IT BY SO MANY CONVINCING TESTIMONS
5639-40744-0031 SO PERSUASIVE WERE HER ENTREATIES AND SO STRONG ASSURANCE AS THAT NO HARM WHATEVER COULD RESULT TO THEM FROM THE INFLAMATION SHE SOUGHT THEY WERE INDUCED TO CONFESS THAT ONE SUMMER'S NIGHT THE SAME SHE HAD MENTIONED THEMSELVES IN ANOTHER FRIEND BEING OUT ON THE STROLL WITH HER DOUWFUL THEY HAD BEEN CONCERNED IN THE ADDUCTION OF THE A GIRL WHOM RE DOLEFUL CARRIED OFF WAS THE REST OF THEM DETAINED HER FAMILY WHO MADE A GREAT OUTCRYY AND WOULD HAVE DEFENDED HER IF THEY COULD
5639-40744-0032 FOR GOD'S SAKE MY LADY MOTHER GIVE ME A WIFE WHO WOULD BE IN AGREEABLE COMPANION NOT ONE WHO WILL DISGUST ME US OF AT ME MAY BOTH BEAR EVENLY AND WITH MUTUAL GOOD WILL THE YOKE IMPOSED ON US BY HEAVEN AND THAT OF PULLING THIS WAY IN THAT WAY AND FRETTING EACH OTHER TO DEATH
5639-40744-0033 HER BEARING WAS GRACEFUL AND ANIMATED SHE LED HER SON BY THE HAND AND BEFORE HER WALKED TWO MAIDS WITH WAXS LIGHTS AND SILVER CANAL STICKS
5639-40744-0034 ARSE TO DO HER REVERENCE AS IF SOMETHING FROM HEAVEN HAD MIRACULOUSLY APPEARED BEFORE THEM BUT GAZING ON HER AND TRANS FOR ADMIRATION NOT ONE OF THEM WAS ABLE TO ADDRESS A SINGLE WORD TO HER
5639-40744-0035 SHE REFLECTED HOW NEAR SHE STOOD TO THE CRISIS WHICH WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER SHE WAS TO BE BLESSED OR UNHAPPY FOR EVER AND RACKPED BY THE INTENSITY OF HER EMOTIONS SHE SUDDENLY CHANGED COLOR HER HEAD DROPPED AS SHE FELL FORWARD IN A SWOON INTO THE ARMS OF THE DISMAYEST A FHINIA
5639-40744-0036 HIS MOTHER HAD LEFT HER TO HIM AS BEING HER DISTIN PROTECTOR BUT WHEN HE SAW THAT HE TOO WAS INSENSIBLE SHE WAS NEAR MAKING A THIRD AND WOULD HAVE DONE SO HAD HE NOT COME TO HIMSELF
5639-40744-0037 NO THEN SON ON MY HEART THAT THIS FAINTING LADY IS YOUR REAL BRIDE I SAY REAL BECAUSE SHE IS THE ONE WHOM YOU FATHER AND I HAVE CHOSEN FOR YOU AND A PORTRAIT WAS A PRETENCE
5639-40744-0038 JUST AT A MOMENT WHEN THE TEARS OF THE PITYING BEHOLDDERS FLOWED FASTEST AND THEIR EJACULATIONS WHEREE MOST EXPRESSIVE OF DESPAIR VILECADIA GA SIGNS OF RECOVERY AND BROUGHT BACK GLADNESS TO THE HEARTS OF ALL
5639-40744-0039 WHERE SHE CAME TO HER ASCENSES AND BLUSHING TO FIND HERSELF IN REDOLF WAS ARMS WOULD HAVE DISENGAGE HERSELF NO SENORA HE SAID THAT MUST NOT BE STRIBE NOT TO WITHDRAW FROM THE ARMS OF HIM WHO HOLDS YOU IN HIS SOULD
5639-40744-0040 THIS WAS DONE FOR THE EVENT TOOK PLAS AT A TIME WITH THE CONSENT TO THE PARTIES WAS SUFFICIENT FOR THE CELEBRATION OF A MARRIAGE WITHOUT ANY OF THE PRELIUMINARY FORMALITIES WHICH I NOW SO PROPERLY REQUIRED
5639-40744-0041 NORIS WERE DO OFF FOR LESS SURPRISE THAN THEY AND THE BETTER TO ASSURE HIMSELF A SO WONDERFUL EFFECT HE BEGG LOCATIA TO GIVE HIM SOME TOKEN WHICH SHOULD MAKE PERFECTLY CLEAR TO HIM THAT WHICH INDEED HE DID NOT DOUBT SINCE IT WAS AUTHENTICATED BY HIS PARENTS
5683-32865-0000 YOU KNOW CAPTAIN LAKE
5683-32865-0001 SAID LORD SHEALFARD ADDRESSING ME
5683-32865-0002 HE HAD HIS HAND UPON LEKE'S SHOULDER
5683-32865-0003 THEY ARE COUSINS YOU KNOW WE ARE ALL COUSINS
5683-32865-0004 WHATEVER LORD CHLFWARD SAID MISS BREND AND RECEIVED IT VERY GRACIOUSLY AND EVEN WITH A MOMENTARY SMILE
5683-32865-0005 BUT HER GREETING TO CAPTAIN LI LAKE WAS MORE THAN USUALLY HAUGHTY AND FROZEN AND HER FEATURES I FANCIED PARTICULARLY PROUD AND PALE
5683-32865-0006 AT DINNER LAKE WAS EASY AND AMUSING
5683-32865-0007 I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT SAYS WHIR ELDER CHUCKLING BEIGNANTLY ON IT OVER HIS SHOULDER
5683-32865-0008 I BELIEVE I HAVE A LITTLE TASTE THAT WAY THOSE ARE ALL REAL YOU KNOW THOSE JEWELS
5683-32865-0009 AND HE PLACED IT IN THAT GENTLEMAN'S FINGERS WHO NOW TOOK HIS TURN AT THE LAMP AND CONSTEMPLATED THE LITTLE PARERLLLELA GRARAM WITH A GLEAM OF SLY AMUSEMENT
5683-32865-0010 I WAS THINKING IT'S VERY LIKE THE ACE OF HEARTS ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN SOFTLY SMILING ON
5683-32865-0011 WHEREUPON LAKE LAUGHED QUIETLY STILL LOOKING ON THE ACE OF HEARTS WITH HIS SLY EYES
5683-32865-0012 AND WILDER LEFT TWO MORE SUDDENLY ANNISILY THE THE HUAR OF THE JOKE SEEMS QUITE TO CALL FOR AND GLANCED A GRIM LOOK FROM THE CORNERS OF HIS EYES UNLAKE BUT THE GALLANT CAPTAIN DID NOT SEEM TO PERCEIVE IT AND AFTER A FEW SECONDS MORE HE HANDED IT VERY INNOCENTLY BACK TO MISSUS DARTHY ONLY REMARKING
5683-32865-0013 DO YOU KNOW LAKE OH I REALLY I CAN'T TELL BUT HE'LL SEEON TIRE OF COUNTRY LIFE
5683-32865-0014 HE'S NOT A MAN FOR COUNTRY QUARTERS
5683-32865-0015 I HAD HORRID DREAM ABOUT HIM LAST NIGHT THAT
5683-32865-0016 OH I KNOW THAT'S LOORN BRANDON
5683-32865-0017 ALL THE TIME HE WAS TALKING TO ME HIS ANGRY LITTLE EYES WERE FOLLOWING LAKE
5683-32866-0000 MIS LAKE DECLINED TO THE CARRIAGE TO NIGHT
5683-32866-0001 AND HE ADDED SOMETHING STILL LESS COMPLIMENTARY
5683-32866-0002 BUT DON'T THESE VERY WISE THINGS SOMETIMES TURN OUT VERY FOOLISHLY
5683-32866-0003 IN THE MEANTIME I HAD FORMED A K NEW IDEA OF HER
5683-32866-0004 BY THIS TIME LORD CHELFARD AND WILDER RETURNED AND DISGUSTED RATHER WITH MYSELF I RUMINATED ON MY WANT OF GENERALSHIP
5683-32866-0005 AND HE MADE A LITTLE DIP OF HIS KING TOWARDS BRAND AND HALL OVER HIS SHOULDER
5683-32866-0006 YES SO THEY SAID BUT THAT WOULD I THINK HAVE BEEN WORSE
5683-32866-0007 IF A FELLOWS BEEN A LITTLE BIT WILD HE IS BEELS ABOB AT ONCE

5683-32866-0011 THEIR WALK CONTINUED SILENT FOR THE GREATERPART NEITHER WAS QUITE SATISFIED WITH THE OTHER BUT RACHEL AT LAST SAID
5683-32866-0012 NOW THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE RADY FOR I REALLY DON'T THINK I ONCE THOUGHT OF HIM ALL THIS EVENING EXCEPT JUST WHIL WE WERE TALKING
5683-32866-0013 THERE WAS A BRIGHT MOONLIGHT BROKEN BY THE SHADOWS OF OVERHANGING BOUGHS AND WITHERED LEAVES AND THE MODELED LIGHTS AND SHADOWS GLIDED ODDLY ACROSS HIS PAILFEATURES
5683-32866-0014 DON'T INSULT ME STANDLELY BY TALKING AGAIN AS YOU DID THIS MORNING
5683-32866-0015 WHAT I SAY IS ALTOGETHER ON YOUR OWN ACCOUNTS

5683-32866-0017 I AM VERY UNEASY ABOUT IT WHATEVER IT IS I CAN'T HELP IT
5683-32866-0018 TO MY MIND THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SOMETHING INEXPRESSIBLY AWFUL IN FAMILY FUDES
5683-32866-0019 THE MYSTERY OF THEIR ORIGIN THEIR CAPACITY FOR EVOLVING LATIN FACULTIES OF CRIME AND THE STUDY VITALITY WITH WHICH THEY SURVIVE THE HEARSE AND SPEAK THEIR DEEP MOUTH MALIGNITIES IN EVERY NEW BORN GENERATION HAVE ASSOCIATED THEM SOMEHOW IN MY MIND WITH A SPELL OF LIFE EXCEEDING AND DISTINCT FOR HUMAN AND ESECIAL SE TAIC ACTION
5683-32866-0020 THE FLOOR WERE THAN ANYTHING ELS SHOWED THE GREAT AGE OF THE ROOM
5683-32866-0021 MY BED WAS UNECCEPTIONALBLY COMFORTABLE BUT IN MY VAN MOOD I COULD HAVE WISHED IT A GREAT DEAL MORE MODERN

5683-32866-0026 I BOLDLY LIGHTED MY CH ROT
5683-32866-0027 A COLD BRIGHT MOON WAS SHINING WITH CLEAR SHARP LIGHTS AND SHADOWS
5683-32866-0028 THE SOMBRE OLD TREES LIKE GIGANTIC HERSE PLUMES BLACK AND AWFUL
5683-32866-0029 SOMEHOW I HAD GROWN NERVOUS
5683-32866-0030 A LITTLE BIT OF PLASTER TUMBLED DOWN THE CHIMNEY AND STARTLED ME CONFOUNDEDLY

6930-76324-0014 THIS THOUGHT HOWEVER DID NOT ENTER THE HEADS OF THE ENTHUSIASTIC PAIR
6930-76324-0015 SMUGLING THE HOUSE CLEANING PAIRFINILIA INTO THE CELLAR WINDOW UNOBSERVED THAT AFTERNOON PROVED NO EASY TASK FOR CYNTHIA HAD ADDED A WHISKED BROOM AND DUS PAN TO THE OUTFIT

6930-76324-0018 HE MAKES IT SORT OF KZIER
6930-76324-0019 NOW IT'S DEUSSTT THE FURNITURE AND PICTURES
6930-76324-0020 YET LITTLE AS IT WAS IT HAD ALREADY MADE A VAST DIFFERENCE IN THE ASPECT OF THE ROOM
6930-76324-0021 SURFACE DOUS AT LEAST HAD BEEN REMOVED AND THE FINE OLD FURNITURE GAVE A HINT OF ITS REAL ELEGANCE AND POLISH
6930-76324-0022 THEN SHE SUDDENLY REMARKED THINK
6930-76324-0023 AND MY POCKET MONEY IS GETTING LOW AGAIN AND YOU HAVE IT ANY LEUGHT AS USUAL
6930-76324-0024 THEY SAY ILLUMINATION BY CANDLEIGHT IS THE PRETTIEST IN THE WORLD

6930-76324-0026 IS IT HA THE GREATEST FOR GINTING INTO ODD CORNERS
6930-76324-0027 FORGETTING ALL THEIR WEARINESS THEY SEIZ THEIR CANDLES AND STREURY THROUGH THE HOUSE FINDING ON OCCASIONAL PAPER TUCKED AWAY IN SOME ODD CORNER
6930-76324-0028 WELL AND CONVINCSED AT THE BOARDED UP HOUSE MYSTERY HAPPENED NOT EARLIER THAN APRIL SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE AND PROUABLY NOT MUCH LATER
6930-81414-0000 NO WORDS WERE SPOKEN NO LANGUAGE WAS UTTERED SAVE THAT OF WAILING IN HISSING AND THAT SOMEHOW WAS INDISTINCT AS IF IT EXISTED IN FANCY AND NOT IN REALITY
6930-81414-0001 I HEARD A NOISE BEHIND I TURNED AND SAW CAFFOR HIS BLACK EYES SHINING WHILLLE IN HIS HAND HE HELD A GLEAMING KNIFE HE LIFTED IT ABOVE HIS HEAD AS IF TOO STRIKE BUT I HAD THE STRENGTH OF TEN MEN AND I HURLED HIM FROM ME
6930-81414-0002 ONORD SAID A DISTANT VOICE
6930-81414-0003 NO SOUND BROKE THE STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT
6930-81414-0004 THE STORY OF ITS EVIL INFLUENCE CAME BACK TO ME AND IN MY BEWILDERED CONDITION I WONDERED WHETHER THERE WAS NOT SOME TRUTH AND WHAT HAD BEEN SAID
6930-81414-0005 WHAT WAS THAT
6930-81414-0006 WHAT THEN A HUMAN HAND LARGE AND SHAPELY APPEAR DISTINCTLY ON THE SURFACE OF THE POND
6930-81414-0007 NOTHING MORE NOT EVEN THE WRIST TO WHICH IT MIGHT BE ATTACHED
6930-81414-0008 IT DID NOT BECKON OR INDEED MOVE AT ALL IT WAS AS STILL AS THE HAND OF DEATH
6930-81414-0009 I AWOKE TO CONSCIOUSNESS FIGHTING AT FIRST IT SEEMED AS IF I WAS FIGHTING WITH THE PHANTOM BUT GRADUALLY MY OPPONENT BECAME MORE REAL TO ME IT WAS CTHER
6930-81414-0010 A SOUND OF VOICES A FLASH OF LIGHT
6930-81414-0011 A FEELING A FREEDOM AND I WAS AWAKE WHERE
6930-81414-0012 SAID ANOTHER VOICE WHICH I RECOGNIZE AS FAOLTEARS CATHER
6930-81414-0013 I HAD SCARCELY KNOWN WHEN I HAD BEEN SAYING OR DOING UP TO THIS TIME BUT AS HE SPOKE I LOOKED AT MY HAND
6930-81414-0014 IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON I SAW ON KNIFE RED WITH BLOOD AND MY HAND TOO WAS ALSO DISCLORED
6930-81414-0015 I DO NOT KNOW I AM DAZED BEWILDERED
6930-81414-0016 BUT THAT IS CATHER'S KNIFE
6930-81414-0017 I KNOW HE HAD IT THIS VERY EVENING
6930-81414-0018 I REUEMBERED SAYING HAVE WE' BEEN TO GTHER
6930-81414-0019 WH CHER PICKED UP SOMETHING FROM THE GROUND AND LOOKED AT IT
6930-81414-0020 I SAY YOU DO KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS AND YOU MUST TELL US
6930-81414-0021 A TERRIBLE THOUGHT FLASHED INTO MY MIND
6930-81414-0022 I HAD AGAIN BEEN ACTING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THIS MAN'S POWER
6930-81414-0023 PERCHANCE TOO CATHER'S DEATH MIGHT SERVE HIM IN GOOD STEAD
6930-81414-0024 MY TONGUE REFUSED ARTICULATE MY POWER OF SPEECH LAGTED ME
6930-81414-0025 MY POSITION WAS TOO TERRIBLE
6930-81414-0026 MY OVERROUGHTEN NERVES YIELDED AT LAST
6930-81414-0027 FOR SOME TIME AFTER THAT I REMEMBERED NOTHING DISTINCTLY
7021-79730-0000 THE THREE MODES OF MANAGEMENT
7021-79730-0001 TO SUPPOSE THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS WORK IS TO AID IN AFFECTING SUCH A SUBSTITUTION IS THAT IS ENTIRELY TO MISTAKE ITS NATURE AND DESIGN
7021-79730-0002 BY REASON AND AFFECTION
7021-79730-0003 AS THE CHASE DRIVES AWAY MARY STANDS BEWILDERED AND PERPLEXED ON THE DOOR STEP HER MIND IN A TUMULT OF EXCITEMENT IN WHICH HATRED OF THE DOCTOR DISTRUST AND SUSPICION OF HER MOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT VEXATION AND ILL HUMOR SURGE AND SWELL AMONG THOSE DELEICATE ORGANIZATIONS ON WHICH THE STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUL SO CLOSELY DEPEND DOING PERHAPS AND A REPARABLE IGJURY
7021-79730-0004 THE MOTHER AS SOON AS THE CHASE IS SO FAR TURNED THAT MARRY CAN NO LONGER WATCH THE EXPRESSION OF HER CONFIDENCE GOES AWAY FROM THE DOOR WITH A SMILE OF COMPLAISENCY AND SAINISF FAACTION ON HER FACE AT THE INGENUITY AND SUCCESS OF HER LITTLE ARTIFICE
7021-79730-0005 SO YOU WILL BE A GOOD GIRL I KNOW AND NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE BUT WILL STAY AT HOME CONTENTEDLY WON'T YOU
7021-79730-0006 THE MOTHER IN MANAGING THE CASE IN THIS WAY REALIZ PARTLY ON CONVINCING THE REASON OF THE CHILD AND PARTLY ON AN APPEAL TO HER AFFECTION
7021-79730-0007 IF YOU SHOULD NOT BE A GOOD GIRL BUT SHOULD SH SIGNS OF MAKING US ANY TROUBLE I SHALL HAVE TO SEND YOU OUT SOMEWHERE TO THE BACK PART OF THE HOUSE UNTIL WE ARE GONE
7021-79730-0008 BUT THIS LAST SUPPOSITION IS ALMOST ALWAYS UNNECESSARY FOR IF MARY HAS BEEN HABITUALLY MANAGED ON THIS PRINCIPLE SHE WILL NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE
7021-79730-0009 IT IS INDEED TRUE THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF TACT AND SKILL IN THE TRAINING OF THE YOUNG AND OF CULTIVATING THEIR REASON AND SECURING THEIR AFFECTION CANNOT BE ORDERTED
7021-79740-0000 TO SUCH PERSONS THESE INDURATE MODES OF TRAINING CHILDREN INHABITS OF SUBORDINATION TO THEIR WILL OR RATHER OF YIELDING TO THEIR INFLUENCE ARE SPECIAL USEFUL
7021-79740-0001 DELAA HAD A YOUNG SISTER NAMEDRIYA AND A COUSIN WHOSE NAME WAS JANE
7021-79740-0002 NOW DEELA CONTRIVED TO OBTAIN A GREAT INFLUENCE AND ASCENDANCY OVER THE MINDS OF THE CHILDREN BY MEANS OF THESE DOLLS
7021-79740-0003 TO GIVE AN IDEA OF THESE CONVERSATIONS I WILL REPORT ONE OF THEM IN FULL
7021-79740-0004 YOU HAVE COME AND DELLRA AND DELLAH WAS THE NAME OF JANE STALL TO MAKE ROSILEY A VISIT
7021-79740-0005 I AM VERY GLAD
7021-79740-0006 I EXPECT YOU HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD GIRL AND DEELLLAH SINCE YOU WERE HERE LAST
7021-79740-0007 THEN TURNING TO JANE SHE ASKED IN A SOMEWHAT ALTERED TONES SHEAP IN A GOOD GIRL JANE
7021-79740-0008 FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN PLAYING UPON THE PIAZZA WITH BLOCKS AND OTHER PLAY THINGS AND FINALLY HAD GONE INTO THE HOUSE LEAVING ALL THE THINGS ON THE FLOOR OF THE PIAZZA INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM AWAY IN THEIR PLACES AS THEY OUGHT TO HAVE DONE
7021-79740-0009 THEY WERE NOW PLAING WITH THEIR DOLLS IN THE PARLOUR
7021-79740-0010 DELYA CAME TO THE PARLUR AND WITH AN AIR OF GREAT MYSTERY BECKONED THE CHILDREN ASIDE AND SAID TO THEM IN A WHISPER LEAVE AND DELA AND ROSALLY HERE AND DON'T SAY A WORD THEM
7021-79740-0011 SO SAYING SHE LED THE WAY ON TIPTO FOLLOWED BY THE CHILDREN OUT OF THE ROOM AND ROUND BY A SIR KUITUS ROOT TO THE PIAZZA THERE
7021-79740-0012 SAID SHE POINTING THE PLAY THINGS SEE
7021-79740-0013 PUUST THESE PLAY THINGS ALL AWAY QUICK AND CAREFULLY AND WE WILL NOT LET THEM KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR LEAVING THEM OUT
7021-79740-0014 AND THIS METHOD OF TREATING THE CASE WAS MUCH MORE EFFECTUAL IN MAKING THEM DISPOSED TO AVOID COMMITTING A SIMILAR FAULT ANOTHER TIME THAN ANY DIRECT REVUKES OR EXPRESSIONS OF DISPLEASURE ADDRESSED PERSONALLY TO THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN
7021-79759-0000 NATURE OF THE EFFECT PRODUCED BY EARLY IMPRESSIONS
7021-79759-0001 THAT IS COMPARATIVELY NOTHING
7021-79759-0002 THEIR ARE CHIEFLY FORMED FROM COMBINATIONS OF THE IMPRESSIONS MADE IN CHILDHOOD
7021-79759-0003 VAST IMPORTANCE AND INFLUENCE OF THIS MENTAL FURNISHING
7021-79759-0004 WITHOUT GOING TO ANY SUCH EXTREME AS THIS WE CAN EASILY SEE ON REFLECTION HOW VAST IN INFLUENCE ON THE IDEAS AND CONCEPTIONS AS WELL AS ON THE PRINCIPLES OF ACTION IN MATURE YARS MUST BE EXERTED BY THE NATURE AND CHARACTER OF THE IMAGES WHICH THE PERIOD OF E INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD IMPRESS UPON THE MIND
7021-79759-0005 THE PAIN PRODUCED BY AN ACT OF HASTY AN ANGRY VIOLENCE TO WHICH A FATHER SUBJECTS HIS SON MAY SOON PASS AWAY BUT THE MEMORY OF IT DOES NOT PASS AWAY WITH THE PAIN
7021-85628-0000 BUT ANDS CARED NOTHING ABOUT THAT
7021-85628-0001 HE MADE A BOUGH SO DEEP THAT HIS BACK CAME NEAR BREAKING AND HE WAS DONE FOUNDED I CAN TELL YOU WHEN HE SAW IT WAS NOBODY BUT ANDS
7021-85628-0002 HE WAS SUCH A BIG BOY THAT HE WORE HIGH BOOTS AND CARRIED A JACKKNIFE
7021-85628-0003 NOW THIS KNIFE WAS SPLENDID ONE THOUGH HALF THE BLADE WAS GONE AND THE HANDLE WAS A LITTLE CRACKED AN ANDDERS NEW THAT ONE IS ALMOST A MAN AS SOON AS ONE HAS A JACKKNIFE
7021-85628-0004 YES WHY NOT THOUGHT ANDS
7021-85628-0005 SEEING THAT I AM SO FINED I MAY AS WELL GO AND VISIT THE KING
7021-85628-0006 I AM GOING TO THE COURT BALL ANSWERED ANDDERERS
7021-85628-0007 AND SHE TOOK AND HER'S HAND AND WALKED WITH HIM UP THE BROAD MARBLE STAIRS WHERE SOLDIERS WERE POSTED AT EVERY THIRD STEP AND THROUGH THE MAGNIFICENT HALLS WHERE COURTIERS IN SILK AND VELVET STOOD BOWING WHERE EVER HE WENT
7021-85628-0008 FO LIKE AS NOT THEY MUST HAVE THOUGHT HIM A PRINCE WHEN THEY SAW HIS FINE CAP
7021-85628-0009 AT THE FARTHER END OF THE LARGEEST HALL A TABLE WAS SET WITH GOLDEN CUPS AND GOLDEN PLATES IN LONG ROSE
7021-85628-0010 ON HUGE SILVER PLATTERS WERE PYRAIDS OF TARTS AND CAKES AND RED WINE SPARKLED IN GLITTERING DECANTERS
7021-85628-0011 THE PRINCESS SAT DOWN UNDER A BLUE CANOPY WITH BQUETS OF ROSES AND SHE LET AND HER SIT IN A GOLDEN CHAIR BY HER SIDE
7021-85628-0012 BUT YOU MUST NOT EAT WITH YOUR CAP ON YOUR HEAD SHE SAID AND WAS GOING TO THEY GET OFF
7021-85628-0013 THE PRINCESS CERTAINLY WAS BEAUTIFUL AND HE WOULD HAVE DEARLY LIKED TO BE KISSED BY HER BUT THE CAP WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD MADE HE WOULD NOT GIVE UP ON ANY CONDITION
7021-85628-0014 HE ONLY SHOOK HIS HEAD
7021-85628-0015 WELL BUT NOW SAID THE PRINCESS AND SHE FILLED HIS POCKETS WITH CAKES AND PUT HER OWN HEAVY GOLD CHAIN AROUND HIS NECK AND BENT DOWN AND KISSED HIM
7021-85628-0016 THAT IS A VERY FINE CAP YOU HAVE HE SAID
7021-85628-0017 SO IT IS SAIDINANREDERS
7021-85628-0018 AND IT IS MADE OF MOTHER'S BEST YORN AND SHE KNITTED HERSELF AND EVERYBODY ONCE TO GET IT AWAY FROM ME
7021-85628-0019 WITH ONE JUMP ANDDERS GOT OUT OF HIS CHAIR
7021-85628-0020 HE DARTED LAKN ARROW THROUGH ALL THE HALLS DOWN ALL THE STAIRS AND ACROSS THE YARD
7021-85628-0021 HE STILL HELD ONTO IT WITH BOTH HANDS AS HE RUSHED INTO HIS MOTHER'S COTTAGE
7021-85628-0022 AND ALL HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS STOOD ROUND AND LISTENED WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN
7021-85628-0023 BUT WHEN HIS BIG BROTHER HEARD THAT HE HAD REFUSED TO GIVE HIS CAP FOR A KING'S GOLDEN CROWN HE SAID THAT ANDS WAS A STUPID
7021-85628-0024 ANDS FACE GREW RED
7021-85628-0025 BUT HIS MOTHER HUGG HIM CLOSE
7021-85628-0026 NO MY LITTLE FN SHE SAID
7021-85628-0027 IF YOU DRESSED IN SILK AND GOLD FROM TOP TO TOE YOU COULD NOT LOOK ANY NICER THAN IN YOUR LITTLE RED CAP
7127-75946-0000 AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE BANQUET WHICH WAS SERVED AT FIVE O'CLOCK THE KING ENTERED HIS CABINET WERE HIS TAYLORS WERE AWAITING HIM FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRYING ON THE CELEBRATED COSTUME REPRESENTING SPRING WHICH WAS THE RESULT OF SO MUCH IMAGINATION AND HAD COUSED SO MANY EFFORTS OF THOUGHT TO THE DESIGNS AND ORNA AN WORKERS OF THE COURT
7127-75946-0001 AH VERY WELL
7127-75946-0002 LET HIM COME IN THEN SAID THE KING AND AS IF KALBERT HAD BEEN LISTENING AT THE DOOR FOR THE PURPOSE OF KEEPING HIMSELF AWKRANTE WITH THE CONVERSATION HE ENTERED AS SOON AS THE KING HAD PRONOUNCED HIS NAME TO THE TWO CARTIERS
7127-75946-0003 JUTLEAN DEER POSTS WHEREUPON SAINTAGYON AND VILERO TOOK THEIR LEAVE
7127-75946-0004 CERTAINLY SIRE BUT I MUST HAVE MONEY TO DO THAT WHAT
7127-75946-0005 WHAT DO YOU MEAN INQUIRED LOISE
7127-75946-0006 HE HAS GIVEN THEM WITH TOO MUCH GRACE NOT TO HAVE OTHERS STILL TO GIVE IF THEY ARE REQUIRED WHICH IS THE CASE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT
7127-75946-0007 IT IS NECESSARY THEREFORE THAT HE SHOULD COMPLY WITH THE KING FROWNED
7127-75946-0008 DOES YOUR MAJESTY THEN NO LONGER BELIEVE THE DISLOYIL ATTEMPT
7127-75946-0009 NOT AT ALL YOU ARE ON THE CONTRARY MOST AGREEABLE TO ME

7127-75946-0011 YOU WILL TAKE THEM FROM MY PRIVATE TREASURE
7127-75946-0012 THE NEWS CIRCULATED WITH THE RAPIDITY OF A LIGHTNING DURING ITS PROGRESS IT CANDLED EVERY VARIET OF COCATRY DESIRE AND WILD AMBITION
7127-75946-0013 THE KING HAD COMPLETED HIS TOILET BY NINE O'CLOCK HE APPEARED IN AN OPEN CARRIAGE DECORATED WITH BRANCHES OF TREES AND FLOWERS
7127-75946-0014 THE QUEENS HAD TAKEN THEIR SEATS UPON A MAGNIFICENT DAY IS OR PLATFORM ERECTED UPON THE BORDERS OF THE LAKE IN A THEATRE OF WONDERFUL ELEGANCE OF CONSTRUCTION
7127-75946-0015 SUDDENLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESTORING PECE IN ORDER SPRAING ACCOMPANIED BY HIS WHOLE COURT MADE HIS APPEARANCE
7127-75946-0016 THE SEASONS ALLIES OF SPRING FOLLOWED HIM CLOSELY TO FORM A QUAD DRERIIL WHICH AFTER MANY WORDS OF MORE OR LESS FLATTERING IMPORT WAS THE COMMENCEMENT OF THEANCE
7127-75946-0017 HIS LEGS THE BEST SHAPED AT COURT WERE DISPLAYED TO GRA ADVANTAGE AND FLESH COLOURED SILKEN HOSE OF SILK SO FINE AND SO TRANSPARENT THAT IT SEEMED ALMOST LIKE FLESH ITSELF
7127-75946-0018 THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS CARRIAGE WHICH RESEMBLED THE BUOYANT MOVEMENTS OF AN IMMORTAL AND HE DID NOT DANCED SO MUCH AS SEEMED TO SOAR ALONG
7127-75946-0019 YES IT IS SUPPRESSED
7127-75946-0020 FAR FROM ITS SIRE YOUR MAJESTYVING GIVEN NO DIRECTIONS ABOUT IT THE MUSICIANS HAVE RETAINEDED
7127-75946-0021 YES SIRE AND READDY DRESSED FOR A BALLLET
7127-75946-0022 SIRE HE SAID YOUR MAJESTS MOST DEVOTED SERVANT APPROACHES TO PERFORM A SERVICE ON THIS OCCASION WITH SIMILAR ZEAL THAT HE HAS ALREADY SHOWN ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE
7127-75946-0023 THE KING SEEMED ONLY PLEASED WITH EVERY ONE PRESENT
7127-75946-0024 MONSIEUR WAS THE ONLYAN WHO DID NOT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT THE MATTER
7127-75946-0025 THE VALLT BEGAN THE EFFECT WAS MORE THAN BEAUTIFUL
7127-75946-0026 WHEN THE MUSIC BY ITS BURSTS OF MELODY CARRIED AWAY THESE ILLUSTRIOUS DANCERS WHEN THE SIMPLE UNTUTORED PANTOMIME OF THAT PERIOD ONLY THE MORE NATURAL ON ACCOUNT OF THE VERY INDIFFERENT ACTING OF THE AUGUST ACTORS HAD REACHED ITS COMULMINATING POINT OF TRIUMPH THE THEATRE SHOOK WITH TUMULTUOUS APPLAUSE
7127-75946-0027 DISDAINFUL OF A SUCCESS OF WHICH MADAME SHOWED NO ACKNOWLEDGMENT HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT BOLDLY REGAINING THE MARKET PREFERENCE OF THE PRINCESS
7127-75946-0028 BY DEGREES ALL HIS HAPPINESSHILE HIS BRILLIANCY SUBSIDED TO REGRET AND UNEASINESS SO THAT HIS LIMBS LOST THEIR POWER HIS ARMS HUNG HEAVILY BY HIS SIDES AND HIS HEAD DROUPED AS THOUGH HE WAS STUPEFIED
7127-75946-0029 THE KING WHO HAD FROM THIS MOMENT BECOME IN REALITY THE PRINCIPLE DCER IN THE QUADRIAL CAST A LOOK UPON HIS VANQUISH RIVAL
7127-75947-0000 EVERY ONEE COULD OBSERVE HIS AGITATION AND PROSTRATION A PROSTRATION WHICH WAS INDEED THE MORE REMARKABLE SINCE PEOPLE WERE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO SEE HIM WITH HIS ARMS HANGING LISTLESSLY BY HIS SIDE HIS HEAD BEWILDERED AND HIS EYES WITH ALL THEIR BRIGHT INTELLIGENCE BE DIMNED
7127-75947-0001 UPON THIS MADAME DINED TO TURN HER EYES LANGUISHINGLY TOWARDS THE CONPTE OBSERVING

7127-75947-0007 SHE THEN ROSE HUMMING THE AIR TO WHAT SHE WAS PRESENTLY GOING TO DANCE
7127-75947-0008 THE ARROW PIERCED HIS HEART AND WOUNDED HIM MORTALLY
7127-75947-0009 A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AFTERWARDS HE RETURNED TO THE THEATRE BUT IT WILL BE READILY BELIEVED THAT IT WAS ONLY A POWERFUL EFFORT OF REASON OVER HIS GREAT EXCITEMENT THAT ENABLED HIM TO GO BACK OR PERHAPS FOR LOVE IS THUS STRANGELY CONSTITUTED HE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE EVEN TO REMAIN MUCH LONGER SEPARATED FROM THE PRESENCE OF ONE WHO HAD BROKEN HIS HEART
7127-75947-0010 WHEN SHE PERCEIVED THE YOUNG MAN SHE ROSE LIKE A WOMAN SURPRISED IN THE MIDST OF IDEAS SHE WAS DESIROUS OF CONCEALING FROM HERSELF

7127-75947-0038 LET US RUN THEN SAID ALL THREE AND GRACEFULLY LIFTING UP THE LONG SKIRTS OF THEIR SILK DRESSES THEY LIGHTLY RAN ACROSS THE OPEN SPACE BETWEEN THE LAKE AND THE THICKEST COVERED OF THE PARK
7127-75947-0039 IN FACT THE SOUND OF MADAMES AND THE QUEEN'S CARRIAGES COULD BE HEARD IN THE DISTANCE UPON THE HARD DRA GROUND OF THE ROADS FOLLOWED BY THE MOUNTAIN CAVALIERS
7127-75947-0040 IN THIS WAY THE FET OF THE WHOLE COURT WAS A FET ALSO FOR THE MYSTERIOUS INHABITANTS OF THE FOREST FOR CERTAINLY THE DEAR IN THE BREAK THE PHEASANT ON THE BRANCH THE FOX IN ITS WHOLE WERE ALL LISTENING
7176-88083-0000 ALL ABOUT HIM WAS A TUMULT OF BRIGHT AND BROKEN COLOR SCATTERED AND BROAD SPLASHES
7176-88083-0001 THE RGANCEER HAD A CRESTED HEAD OF EAR DESCENT GREEN BLACK A BROAD COLLAR OF LUSTROUS WHITE BLACK BACK BLACK AND WHITE WINGS WHITE BELLY SIDES FINELY PINCLLED AND BLACK AND WHITE AND A BREAST OF RICH JUSTT RED STREAKED WITH BLACK
7176-88083-0002 HIS FEET WERE RED HIS LONG NARROW BEAK WITH ITS SOL TOOTH EDGES AND SHARP HOOKED TIP WAS BRIGHT RED
7176-88083-0003 BUT HERE HE WAS AT A TERRIBLE DISADVANTAGE AS COMPARED WITH THE HOURLS HAALKS AND EAGLES HE HAD NO RENDING CLAWS
7176-88083-0004 BUT SUDDENLY STRAIGHT AND SWIFT AS A DI OFING CORMRENT HE SHOT DOWN INTO THE TORRENT AND DISAPPEARED BENEATH THE SURFACE
7176-88083-0005 ONCE FAIRLY A WING HOWEVER HE WHEELED AND MADE BACK HURRIEDLY FOR HIS PERCH
7176-88083-0006 I MIGHT HAVE SEENED THAT A TROUT OF THISISE WAS A FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL MEAL

7176-88083-0013 LIKE HIS UNFORTUNATE LITTLE COUSIN THE TEAL HE TOO HAD FELT A FEAR OF DEATH SMITTEN INTO HIS HEART AND WAS HEADING DESPERATELY FOR THE REFUGE OF SOME DARK OVER HANGING BANK DEEP FRINGED WITH WEEDS WERE THE DREADFUL EYE OF THE HAWK SHOULD NOT DISCERN HIM
7176-88083-0014 THE HAWK SAT UPON THE BRANCH AND WATCHED HIS QUARRIES SWIMMING BENEATH THE SURFACE
7176-88083-0015 ALMOST INSTANTLY YOU HAS FORCED TO THE TOP
7176-88083-0016 STRAIGHTWAY THE HAWK  GLIGHTED FROM HIS PURK AND DARTED AFTER HIM
7176-88083-0017 BUT AT THIS POINT IN THE RAPIDS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO STAY DOWN
7176-88083-0018 BUT THIS FREQUINURE OF THE HEIGHTS OF AIR FOR ALL HIS SAVAGE VALLUR WAS TROUBLED AT THE LEAPING WAVES IN THE TOSSING FOROM OF THESE MAD RAPIDS HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THEM
7176-88083-0019 AS HE FLEW HIS DOWN REACHING CLUTCHING TALENTS WERE NOT HALF A YARD ABOUT THE FUGITIVE HISS HEAD
7176-88083-0020 WHERE THE WAVE IS FOR AN INSTANT SANK THEY CAME CLOSER BUT NOT QUITE WITHIN GRASPING REACH
7176-88083-0021 BUT AS BEFORE THE LEAPING WAVES OF THE RAPIDS WERE TOO MUCH FOR HIS PURSUER AND DOAL ABLE TO FLAP HIS WAY ONWARD IN THE CLOUD OF FOAME WHILE DOOM HUNG LOBE OF HIS HEAD YET HESITATED TO STRIKE
7176-88083-0022 THE HAWK EMBITTERED BY THE LOSS OF HIS FIRST QUARRY HAD BECOME AS DOGGED AND PURSUIT AS A WEASEL NOT TO BE SHAKEN OFF OR EVADED OR DECEIVED
7176-88083-0023 HE HAD A LOT OF LIINE OUT AND THE PLACE WAS NONE TO FREE FOR A LONG CAST BUT HE WAS IMPATIENT TO DROP HIS FLIES AGAIN ON THE SPOT WHERE THE BIG FISH WAS FEEDING
7176-88083-0024 THE LAST DROPFLY AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT CAUGHT JUST THE CORNER OF THE HAWKS ANGRILY OPEN BEAK LOOKING ITSELF FIRMLY
7176-88083-0025 AT THE SUDDEN SHARP STING OF IT THE GREAT BIRD TURNED HIS HEAD AND NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE FISHERMAN STANDING ON THE BANK
7176-88083-0026 THE DRAG UPON HIS BEAK AND THE LIGHT CHECK UPON HIS WINGS WERE INEXPLICABLE TO HIM AND APPAWLLING

7176-92135-0045 LOR JOHN TAKING OUT GOLD CIGARETTE CASE FROM HIS LEFT HAND UPPER WAISTCOAT POCKET
7729-102255-0000 THE BOGAST LEGISLATURE NUMBERED THIRTY SIX MEMBERS
7729-102255-0001 THIS WAS AT THE MARCH ELECTION EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE
7729-102255-0002 THAT SUMMER'S EMIGRATION HOWEVER BEING MAINLY FROM THE FREE STS GREATLY CHANGED THE RELATIVE STRENGTHS OF THE TWO PARTIES
7729-102255-0003 FOR GENERAL SERVICE THEREFORE REQUIRING NO SPECIAL EFFORT THE NEWMERICAL STRENGTH OF THE FACTIONS WAS ABOUT EQUAL ONE ON EXTRAORDINARY OCCASIONS THE TWO THOUSAND BORDER RUFFI IN RESERVE LYING A LITTLE FARTHER BACK FOR THE STATE LINE COULD AT ANY TIME EASILY TURNED THE SCALE
7729-102255-0004 THE FREE STATE MEN HAD ONLY THEIR CONVICTIONS THEIR INTELLIGENCE THEIR COURAGE AND THE MORAL SUPPORT OF THE NORTH THE CONSPIRACY HAD ITS SECRET COMBINATION THE TERRITORIALFICIALS THE LEGISLATURE THE BOGAS LAWS THE COURTS THE MALITIA OFFICERS THE PRESIDENT AND THE ARMY

7729-102255-0007 HIS RECEPTION SPEECH AT WESTPORT IN WHICH HE MAINTAINED THE LEGALITY OF THE LEGISLATURE AND HIS DETERMINATION TO ENFORCE THEIR LAWS DELIGHTED HIS PROSTLABRAY AUDITORS
7729-102255-0008 ALL THE TERRITORIAL DIGNITARIES WERE PRESENT GOVERNOR SHAN AND PRESIDED JOHN CALHOUN THE SURVEYOR GENERAL MADE THE PRINCIPAL SPEECH IT DIDUNCIATION OF THE ABOLITIONIST SUPPORTING THAT TO PEAK A MOVEMENT CHIEF JUSTICE LE CONGNIFIED THE OCCASION WITH APPROVING REMARKS

7729-102255-0011 THE PRESENT CHAPTERS CAN ONLY TOUCH UPON THE MORE SAILINGANT MOVEMENTS OF THE CIVIL WAR CANSAS WHICH HAPPILY OR NOT SANGUINARY IF HOWEVER THE INDIVIDUAL AND MORE ISOLATED CASES OF BLOODSHED COULD BE DESCRIBED THEY WOULD SHOW A STARTLING AGGREGATE OF BARBARITY IN A LOSS OF LIFE FOR OPINION'S SAKE
7729-102255-0012 SEVERAL HUNDRED FREE STATE MEN PROMPTLY RESPONDED TO THE SUMMONS
7729-102255-0013 IT WAS IN FACT THE BEST WEAPON OF ITS DAY
7729-102255-0014 THE LEADERS OF THE CONSPIRACY BECAME DISTRUSTFUL OF THEIR POWER TO CRUSH THE TOWN
7729-102255-0015 ONE AT HIS MALITIA GENERALS SUGGESTED THAT THE GOVERNOR SHOULD REQUIRE THE OUTLAWS AT LAWRENCE AND ELSEWHERE TO SURRENDER THE SHARP'S RIFLES ANOTHER WROTE ASKING HIM TO CALL OUT THE GOVERNMENT TRUTHS AT FORTLEVNWORTH
7729-102255-0016 THE GOVERNOR ON HIS PART BECOMING DOUBTFUL OF THE LEGALITY OF EMPLOYINGSERY MILITIA TO ENFORCE KSAS LAWS WAS ALSO EAGER TO SECURE THE HEALTH A FEDERAL TROOPS
7729-102255-0017 CHARIF JONES HAD HIS POCKETS ALWAYS FULL OFRITS ISSUED IN THE SPIRIT OF PERSECUTION BUT WAS OFTEN BAFFLED BY THE SHARP WITS AND READY RESOURCES OF THE FREE STATE PEOPLE AND SOMETIMES DEFIED OUTRIGHT
7729-102255-0018 LITTLE BY LITTLE HOWEVER THE LATTER BECAME HIMMED AND BOUND IN THE MASCHES OF THE VARIOUS VICEES AND PROCEEDINGS WHICH THE TERRITORIALFICIALS EVOLVED FROM THE BOGESTS LAWLLS
7729-102255-0019 TO EMBARRASS THIS DAMAGING EXPOSURE JUDGE LECOQ ISSUED A WRIT AGAINST THE EX GOVERNOR ON A FRIVOLOUS CHARGE OF CONTEMPT
7729-102255-0020 THE INCIDENT WAS NOT VIOLENT NOR EVEN DRMATIC NO PCSE WAS SUMMON NO FURTHER EFFORT MADE AND READER FEARING PERSONAL VIOL AND SOON FLED IN DISGUISE
7729-102255-0021 BUT THE AFFAIR WAS MAGNIFIED AS A CROWNING PROOF THAT THE FREE STATE MEN WERE INSURRECTIONS AND OUTLAS
7729-102255-0022 FROM THESE AGAIN SPRANG BARRICATED AND FORTIFIED DWELLINGS CAMPSEN SCOUT PARTIES FINALLY CULMINATING IN ROVING GRILLA A BANDS HALF PARTIS AND HALF PREEDATORY
7729-102255-0023 THEIR DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERS HOWEVER DISPLAY ONE BROAD AND UNFAILING DIFFERENCE
7729-102255-0024 THE FREE STATE MEN CLUNG TO THEIR PRAIRIE TOWNS AND PRAIRIE VEINES WITH ALL THE OBSTINACY AND COURAGE OF TRUEY FENDERS OF THEIR HOMES AND FIRE SIDES
7729-102255-0025 THEY ASSUMED CHARACTER CHANGED WITH THEIR CHANGING OPPORTUNITIES OR NECESSITIES
7729-102255-0026 IN THE SHOOTING OF SHERIFF JONES IN LAWNS AND IN THE REFUSAL OF EX GOVERNOR READER TO ALLOW THE DEPUTY MARSHAL TO ARAST HIM THEY DISCOVERED GRAVE OFFENCES AGAINST THE TERRITORIAL AND THE UNITED STAS LAWS
7729-102255-0027 FOOTMOTE SUMMER TO SHANNON MAY TWELVE EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX
7729-102255-0028 PRIVATE PERSONS WHO AT LEAST THE FREE ST DAYATE HOTEL VAINLY BESOUGHT THE VARIOUS AUTHORITIES TO PRESENT THE DESTRUCTION OF THEIR PROPERTY
7729-102255-0029 TEN DAYS WERE CONSUMED IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS BUT THE SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE REFUSED TO YIELD
7729-102255-0030 HE SUMMONED HAPP A DOZEN CITIZENS TO JOIN HIS POSSI WHO FOLLOWED OBEYED AND ASSISTED HIM
7729-102255-0031 HE CONTINUED HIS PRETENDED SURGE AND TO GIVE COLOR TO HIS ERRAND MADE TOO ARREST

7729-102255-0033 AS HE HAD PROMISED TO PROTECT THE HOTEL THE REASSURED CITIZENS BEGAN TO LAUGH AT THEIR OWN FEARCE
7729-102255-0034 TO THEIR SORROW THEY WERE SOON ANDECEIVED
7729-102255-0035 THE MILITARY FORCE PARTLY RABBLE PARTLY ORGANIZED HAD MEANWHILE MOVED INTO THE TOWN
7729-102255-0036 HE PLANEED AT COMPANYED BEFORE THE HOTEL AND DEMANDED A SURRENDER OF THE ARMS BELONGING TO THE FREE STATE MILITARY COMPANIES
7729-102255-0037 HALF AN HOUR LATER TURNING A DEAF EAR TO ALL REMONSTRANCE HE GAVE THE PROPRIETORS UNTIL FIVE O'CLOCK TO REMOVE THEIR FAMILIES AND PERSONAL PROPERTY FROM THE FREE STATE HOTEL
7729-102255-0038 A ATJESON WHO HAD BEEN HURRANGING THE MOB PLANTED HIS TWO GUNS BEFORE THE BUILDING AND TRAINED THEM UPON IT
7729-102255-0039 THE INMATES BEING REMOVED AT THE APPOINTED HOUR A FEW CANNON BALLS WERE FIRED TO THE STONE WALLS
7729-102255-0040 IN THIS INCIDENT CONTRASTING THE CREATIVE AND THE DESTRUCTIVE SPIRIT OF THE FACTIONS THE EMIGRANT AID SOCIETY OF MASSACHUSUS FINDSS MOST HONORABLE AND TRIUMPHANT BNDICATION
7729-102255-0041 THE WHOLE PROCEEDING WAS SO CHILDISH THE MISERABLE PLOT THE SO TRANSPARENT THE OUTRAGE SO GROSS AS TO BRING DISGUSS TO THE BETTER CLASS OF BORDER RUFFIANS WHO WERE WITNESSES ANDCCESSORIES
7729-102255-0042 RE LOCATED FOOTNO GOVERNOR ROBINSON BEING ON HIS WAY EAST THE STEAMBOAT ON WHICH HE WAS TRAVELLING STOPPED AT LEXINGTONSOURIRY
7729-102255-0043 IN A FEW DAYS AN OFFICEER CAME WITH A RECQUISITION FROM GOVERNOR SHANNON AND TOOK THE PRISONER BY LAND A WESTPORT AND AFTERWARDS FROM THERE TO KANSAS CITY INLEVENWORTH
7729-102255-0044 HERE HE WAS PLACED IN THE CUSD OF CAPTAIN MARTIN OF THE KCKOP RANGERS WHO PROVED A KIND JAILER AND MATERIALLY ASSISTED AND PROTECTING HIM FROM THE DANGEROUS INTENTIONS OF THE MOB WHICH AT THAT TIME HEL LEVEN WWORTH UNDER THE REIGIN OF TERROR
7729-102255-0045 CAPTAIN MARTIN SAID I SHALL GIVE YOU A PISTOL TO HE OUT PROTECT YOURSELF IF WORSE COMES TO WORST
7729-102255-0046 IN THE EARLY MORNING OF THE NEXT DAY MAY TWENTY NINETH A COMPANY OF DRAOONS WITH ONE EMPTY SADDLE CAME DOWN FROM THE FORT AND WHILE THE PROSTLAVERY MEN STILL SLEPT THE PRISONER AND HIS ESCORT WERE ON THEIR WAY ACROSS THE PRAIRERS TO LECOMPTENT IN THE CHARGE OF OFFICERS OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY
8224-274381-0000 THOUGH THROWN INTO PRISON FOR THIS ENTERPRISE AND DETAINED SOME TIME HE WAS NOT DISCOURAGED BUT STILL CONTINUED BY HIS COUNTENANCE AND PROTECTION TO INFUSE SPIRIT INTO THE DISTRESSEDRIALISTS
8224-274381-0001 AMONG OTHER PERSONS OF DISTINCTION WHO UNITED THEMSELVES TO HIM WAS LORD APIER OF MARCHSTON SON OF THE FAMOUS INVENTOR OF THE LOGORYTHMS THE PARSSON TO WHOM THE TITLE OF A GREAT MAN IS MORE JUSTLY DUE THE THAN TO ANY OTHER WHOM HIS COUNTRY EVER PRODUCED
8224-274381-0002 WHILE FORMER FORETOLD THAT THE SCOTTISH COVENENTTERS WERE SECRETLY FORMING A UNION WITH THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT AND INCALCATED THE NECESSITY OF PREVENTING THEM BY SOME VIGOROUS UNDERTAKING THE LATTER STILL INSISTED THAT EVERY SUCH ATTEMPT WOULD PRECIPITATEE THEM INTO MEASURES TO WHICH OTHERWISE THEY WERE NOT PERHAPS INCLINED
8224-274381-0003 THE KING'S EARS WERE NOW OPENED TO MONTROSES COUNSILS WHO PROPOSED NONE BUT THE BOLDEST AND MOST DARING AGREEABLY TO THE DESPERATE STATE OF THE ROYAL CAS IN SCOPLAND
8224-274381-0004 FIVE HUNDRED MEN MORE WHO HAD BEEN LEVIED BY THE COVEN ENTERS WERE PERSUADED TO EMBRACE THE ROYAL CAUSE AND WITH THIS COMBINED FORCE HE HASTENED TO ATTACK LORD LCO WHO LAY AT PARTH WITH AN ARMY OF SIX THOUSAND MEN ASSEMBLED UPON THE FIRST NEWS OF THE IRISH INVASION
8224-274381-0005 DREADING THE SUPERIOR POWER OF ARGLEE WHO HAVING JOINED HIS VESSELS TO A FORCE LEVIED BY THE PUBLIC WAS APPROACHING WITH A CONSIDERABLE ARMY MONTRAOSE HASTENED NORTHWARD IN ORDER TO ROUSE AGAIN THE MOCKQUIS OF HUNTLY AND THE GRDENS WHO HAVING BEFORE HASTILY TAKEN ARMS HAD BEEN INSTANTLY SUPPRESSED BY THE COVEN ENTERS
8224-274381-0006 THIS NOBLEMAN'S CHARACTER THOUGH CELEBTED FOR POLITICAL COURAGE AND CONDUCT WAS VERY LOW FOR MILITARY PROWESS AN AFTER SOME SKIRMISHES IN WHICH HE WAS WORSTED HE HEAR ALLOWED MONTROSE TO ESCAPE HIM
8224-274381-0007 BY QUICK MARCHES THROUGH THESE INACCESSIBLE MOUNTAINS THAT GENERAL FREED HIMSELF FROM THE SUPERIOR FORCES OF THE COVENANTERS
8224-274381-0008 WITH THESE AND SOME REENFORCEMENTS OF THE ETHEL MEN AND MANDOMULTS WHOM HE HAD RECLLED MONTROS FELL SUDDENLY UPON ARGYLE'S COUNTRY AND LET LOOSE UPON IT ALL THE RAGE OF WAR CARRYING OFF THE CATTLE BURNING THE HOUSES AND PUTTING THE INHABITANTS TO THE SWORD
8224-274381-0009 THIS SEVERITY BY WHICH MONTROSE SOLID HIS VICTORIES WAS THE RESULT OF PRIVATE ANIMOSITY AGAINST THE CHIEFTAIN AS MUCH AS A ZEAL FOR THE PUBLIC CAUSE ARGULEE COLLECTING THREE THOUSAND MEN MARCHED IN QUEST OF THE ENEMY WHO HAD RETIRED WITH THEIR PLINER AND HE LAY AT INNERLUCKY SUPPOSING HIMSELF STILL AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM THEM
8224-274381-0010 BY A QUICK AND UNEXPECTED MARCH MONTROSE HASTENED TO INERLOCKY AND PRESENTED HIMSELF AN ORDER OF BATTLE BEFORE THE SURPRISED BUT NOT AFFRIGHTENED COVEENTS
8224-274381-0011 HIS CONDUCT AND PRESENCE OF MIND IN THE EMERGANTS APPEARED CONSPICUOUS
8224-274381-0012 MONTROS WEAK IN CAVALRY HERE LINED HIS TROOPS OF HORSE WITH INFANTRY AND AFTER TO PUTTING THE ENEMY'S HORSE TO ROOUT FELL WITH UNITED FORCE UPON THEIR FOOT WHO WERE ENTIRELY CUT IN PIECES THOUGH WITH THE LOSS OF THEIR GALLANT LORD GORDEN ON THE PART OF THE ROYALISTS
8224-274381-0013 FROM THE SAME MEN NEW REGIMENTS AND NEW COMPANIES WERE FORMED DIFFERENT OFFICERS APPOINTED AND THE WHOLE MILITARY FORCE PUT INTO SUCH HANDS AS THE INDEPENDENCE COULD RELY ON
8224-274381-0014 BESIDES MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT WHO WERE EXCLUDED MANY OFFICERS UNWILLING TO SERVE UNDER THE NEW GENERALS THREW UP THEIR COMMISSIONS UN THENWARILY FACILITATED THE PROJECT OF PUTTING THE ARMY ENTIRELY INTO THE HANDS OF THAT FACTION
8224-274381-0015 THAT THE DISCIPLINE OF THE FORMER POARLIAMENTARY ARMY WAS NOT CONTEMPTIBLE A MORE EXACT PLAN WAS INTRODUCED AND RIGOROUSLY EXECUTED BY THESE NEW COMMANDERS
8224-274381-0016 VALEOR INDEED WAS VERY GENERALLY DE DIFFUSED OVER THE ONE PARTY AS WELL AS THE OTHER DURING THIS PERIOD DISCIPLINE ALSO WAS ATTAINED BY THE FORCES OF THE PARLIAMENT BUT THE PERFECTION OF THE MILITARY ART IN CONONCERTING THE GENERAL PLANS OF ACTION AND THE OPERATIONS OF THE FIELD SEEMS STILL ON BOTH SIDES TO HAVE BEEN IN A GREAT MEASURE WANTING
8224-274381-0017 HISTORIANS AT LEAST PERHAPS FROM THEIR OWN IGNORANCE AND INEXPERIENCE HAVE NOT REMARKED ANY THING BUT A HEADLONE IMPETUOUS CONDUCT EACH PARTY HURRYING TO A BATTLE WHERE VALOR UNFORTUNE CHIEFLY DETERMINE THE SUCCESS
8224-274384-0000 HE PASSED THROUGH HENLEY SIN ALBENS AND CAME SO NEARERS AT LONDON AS HARROW ON THE HILL
8224-274384-0001 THE SCOTTISH GENERALS AND COMMISSIONER AS AFFECTED GREAT SURPRISE ON THE APPEARANCE OF THE KING AND THOUGH THEY PAID HIM ON THE EXTERIOR RESPECT DUE TO HIS DIGNITY THEY INSTANTLY SET A GUARD UPON HIM UNDER COLOR OF PROTECTION AND MADE HIM IN REALITY A PRISONER
8224-274384-0002 THEY INFORMED THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT OF THIS UNEXPECTED INCIDENT AND ASSURED THEM THAT THEY HAD ENTERED INTO NO PRIVATE TREATY WITH THE KING
8224-274384-0003 OR HATH HE GIVEN US ANY GIFT
8224-274384-0004 AND THE MEN OF ISRAIL OUTSWERED THE MEN OF JUDA AND SAID WE HAVE TEN PARTS IN THE KING AND WE HAVE ALSO MORE RIGHT IN DAVID THAN YE WHY THEN DID YED DESPISE US THAT OUR ADVICE SHOULD NOT BE FIRST HAD IN BRINGING BACK OUR KING
8224-274384-0005 ANOTHER PREACHER AFTER REPROACHING HIM TO HIS FACE WITH HIS MIS GOOVERNMENT ORDERED THIS SOM TO BE SON
8224-274384-0006 THE KING STOOD UP AND CALLED FOR THAT SUSM WHICH BEGINS WITH THESE WORDS
8224-274384-0007 HAVE MERCY LORD ON ME I PRAY FOR MEN WOULD ME DEVOUR
8224-274384-0008 THE GOOD NATURED ORDIENTENCE IN PITY TO FALLEN MAJESTY SHOWED FOR ONE GREATER DEFERENCE TO THE KING THAN TO THE MINISTER AND SOME THE PM WHICH THE FORMER HAD CALED FOR
8224-274384-0009 THE PARLIAMENT AND THE SCOTS LAID THEIR PROPOSALS BEFORE THE KING
8224-274384-0010 BEFORE THE SETTLEMENT OF TERMS THE ADMINISTRATION MUST BE POSSESSED ENTIRELY BY THE PARLIAMENTS OF BOTH KINGDOMS AND HOW INCOMPATIBLE THAT SCHEM WITH THE LIBERTY OF THE KING IS EASILY IMAGINED
8224-274384-0011 THE ENGLISH IT IS EVIDENT HAD THEY NOTING PREVIOUSLY ASSURED OF RECEIVING THE KING WOULD NEVER HAVE PARTED WITH SO CONSIDERABLE OF SUM AND WHILE THEY WEAKENED THEMSELVES BY THE SAME MEASURE HAVE STRENGTH AND DE PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY MUST OFWARDS HAVE SO MATERIAL AN INTEREST TO DISCUSS
8224-274384-0012 IF ANY STILL RETAINED RANK ARE AGAINST HIM IN HIS PRESENT CONDITION THEY PASSED IN SILENCE WHILE HIS WELL WISHERS MORE GENEROUS THAN PRUDENT ACCOMPANIED HIS MARCH WITH TEARS WITH A CLAMATIONS AND WITH PRAYERS FOR HIS SAFETY
8224-274384-0013 HIS DEATH IN THIS CONJUNCTURE WAS A PUBLIC MISFORTUNE
8230-279154-0000 THE ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE WILL OCCUPY US UNTIL THE END OF THE THIRTEENTH LECTURE AND IS THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF OUR WHOLE ENTERPRISE
8230-279154-0001 WHAT IS CALLED PERCEPTION DIFFERS FROM SENSATION BY THE FACT THAT THE SENSATIONAL INGREDIANCE BRING UP HABITUAL ASSOCIATES IMAGES AN EXPECTATIONS OF THEIR USUAL CORLIETS ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECTIVELY INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE SENSATION
8230-279154-0002 WHETHER OR NOT THIS PRINCIPLEAL IS LIABLE TO EXCEPTIONS EVERY ONE WOULD AGREE THAT IT HAS A BROAD MEASURE OF TRUTH THOUGH THE WORD EXACTLY MIGHT SEEM AN OVER STATEMENT AND IT MIGHT SEEM MORE CORRECT TO SAY THAT IES A PROXIMATELY REPRESENT IMPRESSIONS
8230-279154-0003 AND WHAT A SORT OF EVIDENCE IS LOGICALLY POSSIBLE
8230-279154-0004 THERE IS NO LOGICAL IMPOSSIBILITY AND THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE WORLD SPRANG INTO BEING FIVE MINUTES AGO EXACTLY AS IT THEN WAS WITH THE POPULATION THAT REMEMBERED A WHOLLLY UNREAL PASSED
8230-279154-0005 ALL THAT I AM DOING IS TO USE ITS LOGICAL TENABILITY AS A HELP IN THE ANALYSIS OF WHAT OCCURS WHEN WE REMEMBER
8230-279154-0006 THE BEHAVIOURUS TO ATTEMPT TO MAKE PSYCHOLOGY A RECORD OF BEHAVIOUR HAS TO TRUST HIS MEMORY AND MAKING THE RECORD
8230-279154-0007 HABIT IS A CONCEPT INVOLVING THE OCCURRENCE OF SIMILAR EVENTS AT DIFFERENT TIMES IF THE BE BAHAVIORST FELLS CONFFIDENT THAT THERE IS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS HABIT THAT CAN ONLY BE BECAUSE HE TRUST HIS MEMORY WHEN IT ASSURES HIM THAT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER TIMES
8230-279154-0008 BUT I DO NOT THINK SUCH AN EFFERENCE IS WARANTRANTED
8230-279154-0009 OUR CONFIDENCE OR LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE ACCURACY OF A MEMORY IMAGE MUST INFUNDAMENTAL CASES BE BASED UPON A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE IMAGE ITSELF SINCE WE CANNOT EVOKE THE PAST BODILY AND COMPARE IT WITH THE PRESENT IMAGE
8230-279154-0010 WE SOMETIMES HAVE IMAGES THAT ARE BY NO MEANS PECULIARLY VAGUE WHICH YET WE DO NOT TRUST FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF FATIGUE WE MAY SEE A FRANCE FACE VIVIDLY AND CLEARLY BUT HORRIBLY DISTORTED
8230-279154-0011 SOME IMAGES LIKE SOME SENSATIONS FILL VERY FAMILIAR WHILE OTHERS FILL STRANGE
8230-279154-0012 FAMILIARITY IS A FILLING CAPABLE OF DEGREES
8230-279154-0013 IN AN IMAGE OF A WELL KNOWN FACE FOR EXAMPLE SOME PARTS MAY FEEL MORE FAMILIAR THAN OTHERS WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE HAVE MORE BELIEF IN THE ACCURACY OF THE FAMILIAR PARTS THAN IN THAT OF THE UNFMILIAR PARTS
8230-279154-0014 I COME NOW TO THE OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MEMORY IMAGES MUST HAVE IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
8230-279154-0015 THEY MUST HAVE SOME CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MAKES US REGARD THEM AS REFERRING TO MORE OR LESS REMOTE PORTIONS OF THE PAST
8230-279154-0016 IN ACTUAL FACT THERE ARE DOUBTLESS VARIOUS FACTORS THAT CONCUR AND GIVING US THE FILLING OF GREATER OR LESS REMOTENESS IN SOME REMEMBERED EVENENT
8230-279154-0017 THERE MAY BE A SPECIFIC FILLING WHICH COULD BE CALLED THE FILLING OF PASTNESS ESPECIALLY WHERE IMMEDIATE MEMORY IS CONCERNED
8230-279154-0018 THERE IS OF COURSE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNOWING THE TEMPORAL RELATION OF A REMEMBERED EVENENT TO THE PRESENT AND KNOWING THE TIME ORDER OF TO REMEMBERED EVENTS
8230-279154-0019 IT WOULD SEEM THAT ONLY RATHER RECENT EVENTS CAN BE PLACED AT ALL ACCURATELY BY MEANS OF FEELINGS GIVING THEIR TEMPORARAL RELATION TO THE PRESENT BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT SUCH FILLINGS MUST PLAY AN ESSENTIAL PART IN THE PROCESS OF DTING REMEMBERED ADVTS
8230-279154-0020 IF WE HAD RETAINED THE SUBJECT OR ACT IN KNOWLEDGE THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF MEMORY WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPARATIVELY SIMPLE
8230-279154-0021 REMEMBERING HAS TO BE A PRESENT OCCURRENCE IN SOME WAY RESEMBLING ORLATED TO WHAT IS REMEMBERED
8230-279154-0022 SOME POINTS MAY BE TAKEN AS FIXED AND SUCH AS ANY THEORY OF MEMORY MUST ARRIVE AT
8230-279154-0023 IN THIS CASE AS A MOST OTHERS WHAT MAY BE TAKEN A CERTAIN IN ADVANCE IS RATHER VAY
8230-279154-0024 THE FIRST OF OUR VAGUE BUT INDIUBITABLE DATA IS THAT THERE IS KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
8230-279154-0025 WE MIGHT PROVISIONALLY THOUGH PERHAPS NOT QUITE CORRECTLY DEFINE MEMORY AS THAT WAY OF KNOWING ABOUT THE PAST WHICH HAS NO ANALOGUE IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE FUTURE SUCH A EFINITION WOULD AT LEAST SERV TO MARK THE PROBLEM WITH WHICH WE ARE CONCERNED THOUGHO SOME EXPECTATIONS MAY DESERVE TOY RANK WITH MEMORY AS REGARDS IMMEDIACY
8230-279154-0026 THIS DISTINCTION IS VITAL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF MEMORY BUT IT IS NOT SO EASY TO CARRY OUT IN PRACTICE AS IT IS TO DRAW IN THEORY
8230-279154-0027 A GRAMMAFHONE BY THE HELP OF SUITABLE RECORDS MIGHT RELATE TO US THE INCIDENTS OF ITS PAS AND PEOPLE ARE NOT SO DIFFERENT FROM GRAMIFUNDS AS THEY LIKE TO BELIEVE
8230-279154-0028 I CAN SET TO WORK NOW TO REMEMBER THINGS I NEVER REMEMBERED BEFORE SUCH AS WHAT I HAD TO EAT FOR BREAKFAST THIS MORNING AND IT CAN HARDLY BE WHOLLY HABIT THAT ENABLES ME TO DO THIS
8230-279154-0029 THE FACT THAT A MAN CAN RECITE A POEM DOES NOT SHOW THAT HE REMEMBERS ANY PREVIOUS OCCASION ON WHICH HE HAS RECITED OR READ IT
8230-279154-0030 SEIMON'S TO BOOKS MENTIONED IN AN EARLIER LECTURE DO NOT TOUCH KNOWLEDG MEMORY AT ALL CLOSELY
8230-279154-0031 THEY GIVE LAWS ACCORDING TO WHICH IMAGES OF PASTS OCCURRENCES COME INTO OUR MINDS BUT DO NOT DISCUSS OUR BELIEF THAT THESE IMAGES REFER TO PASS OCCURRENCES WHICH IS WHAT CONSTITUTES KNOWLEDGE MEMORY
8230-279154-0032 IT IS THIS THAT IS OF INTEREST TO THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE
8230-279154-0033 IT IS BY NO MEANS ALWAYS RELIABLE ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS AT SOMETIM EXPERIENCED THE WELL KNOWN ILLUSION THAT ALL THAT HAS HAPPENING NOW HAPPENED BEFORE AT SOME TIME
8230-279154-0034 WHENEVER THE SENSE OF FAMILIARITY OCCURS WITHOUT A DEFINITE OBJECT IT LEAS US TO SEARCH THE ENVIRONMENT UNTIL WE ARE SATISFY THAT WE HAVE FOUND THE APPROPRIATE OBJECT WHICH LEAD US TO THE JUDGMENT THIS IS FAMILIAR
8230-279154-0035 THUS NO KNOWLEDGE AS TO THE PAST IS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE FEELING OF FAMILIARITY ALONE
8230-279154-0036 A FURTHER STAGE IS RECOGNITION
8230-279154-0037 RECOGNITION IN THIS SENS DOES NOT NECESSARILY INVOLVE MORE THAT A HABIT OF ASSOCIATION THE KIND OF OBJECT WE ARE SEEING AT THE MOMENT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORD CAT OR WITH AN OUDITORY IMAGE OF PURRING OR WHATEVER OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WE MAY HAPPEN TO RECOGNIZE IN THE CAT OF THE MOMENT
8230-279154-0038 BUT WE ARE OF COURSE IN FACT ABLE TO JUDGE WHEN WE RECOGNIZE AN OBJECT THAT WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE BUT THIS JUDGMENT IS SOMETHING OVER AND ABOVE RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SINCEE AND MAY VERY PROBABLY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ANIMALS THAT NEVERTHELESS HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE OF THE WORD
8230-279154-0039 THIS KNOWLEDGE IS MEMORY IN ONE SENSE THOUGH IN AN ANOTHER IT IS NOT
8230-279154-0040 THERE ARE HOWEVER SEVERAL POINTS IN WHICH SUCH AN ACCOUNT OF RECOGNITION IS INADEQUIP TO BEGIN WITH IT MIGHT SEEM AT FIRST SIGHT MORE CORRECT TO DEFINE RECOGNITION AS I HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE THAN AS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE
8230-279154-0041 THE DEFINITION OF MY EXPERIENCE IS DIFFICULT BROADLY SPEAKING IT IS EVERYTHING THAT IS CONNECTED WITH WHAT I AM EXPERIENCING NOW BY CERTAIN LINKS OF WHICH THE VARIOUS FORMS OF MEMORY ARE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT
8230-279154-0042 THUS IF I RECOGNIZE A THING THE OCCASION OF ITS PREVIOUS EXISTENCE IN VIRTUE OF WHICH I RECOGNIZE IT FORMS PART OF MY EXPERIENCE BY DEFINITION RECOGNITION WILL BE ONE OF THE MARKS BY WHICH MY EXPERIENCE IS SINGLEBT FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD
8230-279154-0043 OF COURSE THE WORDS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE ARE A VERY INADEQUATE TRANSLATION OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHEN WE FORM A JUDGMENT OF RECOGNITION BUT THAT IS UNAVOIDABLE WORDS ARE FRAMED TO EXPRESS A LEVEL THOUGHT WHICH IS BY NO MEANS PERMATIVE AND ARE QUITE INCAPABLE OF EXPRESSING SUCH AN ELEMENTARY OCCURRENCE AS RECOGNITION
8455-210777-0000 I REMAINED THERE ALONE FOR MANY HOURS BUT I MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BEFORE I LEFT THE CHAMERS I HAD GRADUALLY BROUGHT MYSELF TO LOOK AT THE MATTER IN ANOTHER LIGHT
8455-210777-0001 HAD ETHER CRSWELLER NOT BEEN GOOD LOOKING HAD JACK BEEN STILL A COLLEGE HAD SIR KENINTONV REMAINED IN ENGLAND HAD MISTER BNNET AND THE BARKEEPER NOT SUCCEEDED AND STOPPING MY CARRIAGE ON THE HILL SHOULD I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN A RADING FOR THE FINAL DEPARTURE OF MY OLD FRIEND
8455-210777-0002 ON ARRIV AT HOME AT MY OWN RESIDENCE I FOUND THAT OURCALON WAS FILLED WITH A BRILLIANT COMPANY
8455-210777-0003 AS I SPOKE I MADE HIM A GRACIOUS BOW AND I THINK I SHOWED HIM BY MY MODE OF ADDRESS THAT I DID NOT BEAR ANY GRUDGE AS TO MY INDIVIDUAL SELF
8455-210777-0004 I HAVE COME TO YOUR SUURES MISTER PRESIDENT WITH THE PURPOSE OF SEEING HOW THINGS ARE PROGRESSING IN THIS DISIN QUARTER OF THE WORLD
8455-210777-0005 WE HAVE OUR LITTLE SHRUGGLES HERE AS ELSEWHERE AND ALL THINGS CANNOT BE DONE BY ROSE WAR
8455-210777-0006 WE ARERE QUITE SATISFIED NOW CAPTAIN BATTLE AASE SAID MY WIFE
8455-210777-0007 QUITE SATISFIED SAID EV
8455-210777-0008 THE LADIES AND COMPLIANCE WITH THAT SOFTNESS OF HAR WHICH IS THEIR CHARACTERISTIC ARE ON ONE SIDE AND THE MEN BY WHOM THE WORLD HAS TO BE MANAGED ARE ON THE OTHER
8455-210777-0009 NO DOUBT AND PROCESS OF TIME THE LADIES WILL FATHER
8455-210777-0010 THEIR MASTER SAID MISSUS NEVER BE BEEN
8455-210777-0011 I DID NOT MEAN SAID CAPTAIN BATTIALAGX TO TOUCH UPON PUBLIC SUBJECTS AT SUCH A MOMENT AS THIS
8455-210777-0012 MISSUS NEVER BEEN YOU MUST INDEED BE PROUD OF YOUR SON
8455-210777-0013 JACK HAD BEEN STANDING IN THE FOUR CORNER OF THE ROOM TALKING TO EV AND WAS NOW REDUCED A SILENCE BY HIS PRAISES
8455-210777-0014 SIR KENNINGTON OVAL IS A VERY FINE PLAYER SAID MY WIFE
8455-210777-0015 I AND MY WIFE AND SUN AND THE TWO PRESSWELLERS AND THREE OR FOUR OTHERS AGREED TO DINE ON BOARD THE SHIP ON THE NEXT
8455-210777-0016 THIS I FELT WAS PAIDY TO ME AS BEING PRESIDENT OTHER REPUBLIC AND I ENDEAVOURED TO BEHAVE MYSELF WITH SUCH MINGLED HUMILITY AND DIGNITY AS MIGHT BE FIT THE OCCASION BUT I COULD NOT A FEEL THAT SOMETHING WAS WANTING TO THE SIMPLICITY OF MY ORDINARY LIFE
8455-210777-0017 MY WIFE ON THE SPUR THE MOMENT MANAGED TO GIVE THE GENTLEMEN A VERY GOOD DINNER
8455-210777-0018 THIS SHE SAID WAS TRUE HOSPITALITY AND I AM NOT SURE I DID NOT AGREE WITH THERE
8455-210777-0019 THEN THERE WERE THREE OR FOUR LEADING MEN OF THE COMMUNITY WITH THEIR WIVES WHO WERE FOR THE MOST PART THE FATHERS AND MOTHERS OF THE YOUNG LADIES
8455-210777-0020 OH YES SAID JACK AND I'M KNOWHERE
8455-210777-0021 BUT I MEAN TO HAVE MY INNINGS BEFORE LONG
8455-210777-0022 OF WHAT MISSUS NEVER BEEN HAD GONE THROUGH IN PROVIDING BIRDS BEASTS AND FISHES NOT TO TALK OF TARTS AND JEELIES FOR THE DINNER OF THAT DAY NO ONE BUT MYSELF CAN HAVE ANY IDEA BUT IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT SHE ACCOMPLISHED HER TASK WITH THOROUGH SUCCESS
8455-210777-0023 WE SAT WHAT THE OFFICER SOME LITTLE TIME AFTER DINNER AND THEN WENT ASHORE
8455-210777-0024 HOW MUCH OF EVIL OF REAL ACCOMPLISHED EVIL HAD THERE NOT OCCURRED TO ME DWING THE LAST FEW DAYS
8455-210777-0025 WHATT I DO NOW BUT JUST LAME MYSELF DOWN AND DIE
8455-210777-0026 AND THE DEATH OF WHICH I DREAMKT COULD NOT ALAS
8455-210777-0027 WHEN THIS CAPTAIN SHOULD HAVE TAKEN HIMSELF AND HIS VESSEL BACK TO ENGLAND I WOULD RETIRE TO A SMALL FARM WHICH I POSSESSED AT THE FURTHEREST SIDE OF THE ISLAND AND THERE IN SECLUSION WHAT I END MY DAYS
8455-210777-0028 JACK WOULD BECOMEVE IS HAPPY HUSBAND AND WOULD REMAIN AMST THE HURRIED DUTIES OF THE EAGER WORLD
8455-210777-0029 THINK OF ALL THIS I WENT TO SLEEP
8455-210777-0030 MISTER NEVER BEN BEGAN THE CAPTAIN AND I OBSERV THAT UP TO THAT MOMENT HE HAD GENERALLY ADDRESSED ME AS PRESIDENT THERE CANNOT BE DENIED THAT WE HAVE COME HERE ON AN UNPLEASANT MISSION
8455-210777-0031 YOU HAVE RECEIVED US WITH ALL THAT COURTESING HOSPITALITY FOR WHICH YOUR CHARACTER IN ENGLAND STAND SO HIGH
8455-210777-0032 IT ISN'T DUTY SAID I
8455-210777-0033 BUT YOUR POWER IS SO SUPERI TO ANY THAT I CAN ADVANCE AS TO MAKE US HERE FEEL THAT THERE IS NO DISGRACE IN YIELDING TO IT
8455-210777-0034 NOT ADUBT BUT HAD YOUR FORCE BEEN ONLY DOUBLE OR TROUBLE OUR OWN I SHOULD HAVE FOUND AT MY DUTY TO SHRUGGLE WITH YOU
8455-210777-0035 THAT IS ALL QUITE TRUE MISTER NEVER BEEN SAID SIR FERDIN AND NO BROWN
8455-210777-0036 I CAN AFFORD TO SMILE BECAUSE I AM ABSOLENTELY PERILLESS BEFORE YOU BUT I DO NOT THE LESS FEEL THAT IN A MATTER OF WHICH THE PROGRESS OF THE WORLD IS CONCERNED I OR RATHER WE HAVE BEEN PUT DOWN BY BRUTE FORCE
8455-210777-0037 YOU HAVE COME TO US THREATENING US WITH ABSOLUTE DESTRUCTION
8455-210777-0038 THEREFORE I FEEL MYSELF QUITE ABLE AS PRESIDENT OF THIS REPUBLIC TO RECEIVE YOU WITH A COURTESY DO TO THE SERVANTS OF A FRIENDLY ALLY
8455-210777-0039 I CAN ASSURE YOU HE HAS NOT EVEN ALLOWED ME TO SEE THE TRIGGER SINCE I HAVE BEEN ON BOAR
8455-210777-0040 THEN SAID SIR FERDINANDO THERE'S NOTHING FOR BUT THAT WE MUST TAKE YOU WITH HIM
8455-210777-0041 THERE CAME UPON ME A SUDDEN SHOCK WHEN I HEARD THESE WORDS WHICH EXCEEDED ANYTHING WHICH I HAD YET FELL
8455-210777-0042 YOU HEAR WHAT SIR FERRIN ANDLL BROWN HA SAID REPLIED CAPTAIN BATTLE AX
8455-210777-0043 BUT WHAT IS A DELICATE MISSSION I ASKED
8455-210777-0044 I WAS TO BE TAKEN AWAY AND CARRIED TO ENGLAND OR ELSEWHERE WERE DROWNED UPON THE VOYAGE AND MATTERED NOTIT
8455-210777-0045 THEN THE REPUBLIC OF BRIN MUULI WAS TO BE DECLARED ASN EXISTENT AND THE BRITISH FLAG WAS TO BE EX AALTED AND A BRITISH GOVERNOR INSTALLED IN THE EXECUTIVE CHAMBERS
8455-210777-0046 YOU MAY BE QUITE SHORTS THERE SAID CAPTAIN BATTLE AXE AND THAT I CAN SO USE IT AS TO HALF ABLITERATE YOUR TOWN WITHIN TWO MINUTES OF MY RETURN ON BOARD

8455-210777-0056 THE PROECULIAR A CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE COLONY ARE WITHIN YOUR EXCELLENCIES KNOWLEDGE
8455-210777-0057 BUT IN THEIR SELECTION OF A CONSTITUTION THE BRITTAIN NEW LIISTS HAVE UNFORTUNATELY ALLOWED THEMSELVES BUT ONE DELIBERATE ASSEMBLY AND HENCE HAS SPRUNG THEIR PRESENT DIFFICULTIES
8455-210777-0058 IT IS FOUNDED ON THE ACKNOWLEDGE WEAKNESS OF THOSE WHO SURVIVE THAT PEERED OF LIFE AT WHICH MEN CEASE TO WORK
8455-210777-0059 BUT IT IS SUR MAISE THAT YOU WILL FIND DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY OF YOUR ENTERING AT ONCE UPON YOUR GOVERNOR

8455-210777-0070 AND THIS PLAN WAS ADOPTED TOO IN ORDER TO EXTRACT FROM ME A PROMISE THAT I WOULD DEPART IN PEACE
8463-287645-0000 THIS WAS WHAT DID THE MISCHIEF SO FAR AS THE RUNNING AWAY WAS CONCERNED
8463-287645-0001 IT IS HARDLY NECESSARY TO SAY MORE OF THEM HERE
8463-287645-0002 FROM THE MANNER IN WHICH HE EXPRESSED HIMSELF WITH HER GOING TO ROBERT HOLLAND NO MAN IN THE WHOLE RANGE OF HIS RECOLCTIONS WILL BE LONGER REMEMBERED THAN HE HIS IN THRMENT WHILE UNDERHALLAND WILL HARDLY EVER BE FORGOTTEN
8463-287645-0003 OF THIS PARTY EDWARD A BOY OF SEVENTEEN CALLED FORTH MUCH STYMPATHY HE TOO WAS CLAIMED BY HOLLAND
8463-287645-0004 JOHN WESY COMBASE JAAKO TAYILOR AND THOMAS EDWARD SKINNER

8463-287645-0006 THE DOCTOR WHO ATTENDED THE INJURED CREATURE IN THIS CAS WAS SIMPLY TOLD THAT SHE SLIPPED AND FELL DOWN THE STAIRS AS SHE WAS COMING DOWN
8463-287645-0007 ANOTHER CASE SAID JOHN WESLEY WAS A LITTLE GIRL HALF GROWN WHO WAS WASHING WINDOWS UPSTAIRS ONE DAY AND UNLUELCKILY FELL ASLEEP IN THE WINDOW AND IN THIS POSITION WAS FOUND BY HER MISTRESS IN ARAGED THE MISTRESS HID HER A HEAVY SLAP KNOCKED HER OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SHE FELLT TO THE PAVEMENT AND DIED IN A FEW HOURS FROM THE EFFECTS THEREOF

8463-287645-0012 SUBSTANTIALLY THIS WAS JACOBP'S UNVARNISHED DESCRIPTION OF HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS
8463-287645-0013 AS HIS AGE AND ALSO THE NAME OF HIS MASTER JANOB STATEMENT VARIED SOMEWHAT FROM THE ADVERTISEMENT
8463-287645-0014 OF STARTING I DIDN'T KNOW THE WAY TO COME
8463-294825-0000 IT'S ALMOST BEYOND CONJECTURE
8463-294825-0001 THIS REALITY BEGANS TO EXPLAIMED DARK POWER AND OTHER WORLDLY FASCINATION OF TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEASED
8463-294825-0002 FIRST AS A PARIS DCBROKER LATER AS A CELEBRATED AUTHOR AND YODSMAN HE WENT ON FREQUENT VOYAGES TO BRITON AMERICA THE MEDIRANEAN

8463-294825-0005 OTHER SUBTLETIES OCCURR INSIDE EACH ASODTE THE TEXURES SPARKLING WITH WIT INFORMATION AND IN SIGHT
8463-294825-0006 HIS SPECIF OICCCASIONS FOR AN OPEN SEA SUBMAREENE AT THE SELF CONTAINING DIVING SUIT WERE DECADES BEFORE THEIR TIME YET MODERN TENOLEDGY BES THE MOUN TRIUMPHANTLY

8463-294825-0012 THE NAUTILUS NEARLY PARISHES IN THE ANTARCTTIC AND NEMO SINKS INTO A GROWING DEPRESSION

8463-294828-0001 THREE SECONDS BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF J BE HOBSON'S LETTER I KNOW MORE DREAMED OF CHASING THE UNICORN THAN OF TRIING FOR THE NORTHWEST PASSAGE
8463-294828-0002 EVEN SO I HAD JUST RETURNED FROM AN ARDUOUS JOURNEY EXHAUSTED AND BADLY NEETING A REST
8463-294828-0003 I WANTED NOTHING MORE THAN TO SEE OUR COUNTRY AGAIN MY FRIENDS MY MODEST QUARTERS BY THE PTANICAL GARDENS MY DEARLY BELOVED COLLECTIONS
8463-294828-0004 BUT NOW NOTHING COULD HOLD ME BACK
8463-294828-0005 CONSEIL WAS MY MANSERVANT
8463-294828-0006 FROM BRUBBY SHOULDERS WITH SCIENTISTS IN OUR LITTLE UNIVERSE BY THE PTANICAL GARDENS THE BOY HAD COME TO KNOW A THING OR TWOO
8463-294828-0007 CLASSIFYING WAS EVERYTHING TO HIM SO HE KNEW NOTHING ELSE WELL VERSED IN A THEORY OF CLASSIFICATION HE WAS POORLY VER FIRSTED INS PRACTICAL APPLICATION AND ADOUBT THAT HE COULD TELL A SPERM WHALE FROM A BLLLEON WHALE
8463-294828-0008 AND YET WHAT A FINE GALLANT LAD
8463-294828-0009 NOT ONCE DID HE COMMENT ON THE LENGTH OR THE HARDSHIPS OF THE JOURNEY
8463-294828-0010 NEVER DID HE OBJECT TO BUCKLING UP HIS SUIT CAASE FOR ANY COUNTRY WHATEVER CHINA OR THE CONGO NO MATTER HOW FAR OFF IT WAS
8463-294828-0011 HE WHEN HERE THERE AND EVERYWHERE IN PERFECT CONTENTMENT
8463-294828-0012 PLACE FORGIVE ME FOR THIS UNDERHANED WAY OF ADMITTING THAT I HAD TURNED FORTY
8463-294828-0013 HE WAS A FANATIC ON FORMALITY AND HE ONLY ADDRESSED ME IN THE THIRD PERSON TO THE POINT WHERE IT GOT HIRESOME
8463-294828-0014 THERE WAS GOOD REASON TO STOP AND THINK EVEN FOR THE WORLD'S MOST EMOTIONLESS MAN
8463-294828-0015 CONSEIL I CALLED A THIRD TIME CONSEIL APPEARED

8463-294828-0021 A ROT SLIGHTLY LESS DIRECT THAT'S ALL
8463-294828-0022 WE WERE LEAVING ON THE ABRAHAMB LINCOLN
8463-294828-0023 YOU SEE MY FRIEND IT'S AN ISSUE OF THE MONSTER THE NOTORIOUS NARWHALE
8463-294828-0024 WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT WILL TAKE US
8463-294828-0025 BUT WE'RE GOING JUST THE SAME
8463-294828-0026 WE HAVE A COMMANDER WHOSE GAME FOR ANYTHING
8463-294828-0027 I LEFT INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHIPPING MY CONTAINERS OF STUFFED ANIMALS AND DRIED PLANTS TO PARIS FRANCE
8463-294828-0028 I OPENED A LINE OF CREDIT SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE BUBBARUSA AND CONSEIL AT MY HEELS I JUMPED INTO A CARRIAGE
8463-294828-0029 OUR BAGGAGE WAS IMMEDIATELY CORIED TO THE DECK OF THE FRIGATE I RUSHED ABOARD
8463-294828-0030 I ASKED FOR COMMANDER FARRAGUT
8463-294828-0031 ONE OF THE SAILORS LED ME TO THE AFTERDECK WHERE I STOOD IN THE PRESENCE OF A SMART LOOKING OFFICER WHO EXTENDED HIS HAND TO ME
8463-294828-0032 IN PERSON WELCOME ABOARYD PROFESSOR YOUR CABIN IS WAITING FOR YOU
8463-294828-0033 I WAS WELL SATISFIED WITH MY CABIN WHICH WAS LOCATED IN THE STERN AND OPENED INTO THE OFFICERS MESS

8463-294828-0035 AND SO IF I HAD BEEN DELAYED BY A QUARTER OF AN HOUR OR EVEN LESS THE FRIGATE WOULD HAVE GONE WITHOUT ME AND I WOULD HAVE MISSED OUT ON THIS UNEARTHLY EXTRAORDINARY AND INCONCEIVABLE EXPEDITION WHOSE TRUE STORY MIGHT WELL MEET WITH SOME SKEPTICISM
8463-294828-0036 THE WARFS OF BROOKLYN AND EVERY PART OF NEW YORK BORDERING THE EAST RIVER WERE CROWDED WITH CURIOSITY SEEKERS
8463-294828-0037 DEPARTING FROM FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND THROATS THREE CHEERS BURST FORTH IN SUCCESSION
8463-294828-0038 THOUSANDS OF HANDKERCHIEFS WERE WAVING ABOVE THESE TIGHTLY PACKED MASSES HAILING THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN UNTIL IT REACHED THE WATERS OF THE HUDSON RIVER AT THE TIP OF THE LONG PININCIAL THAT FORMS NEW YORK CITY
8555-284447-0000 THEN HE RUSHED DOWN STAIRS INTO THE COURTYARD SHOUTING LOUDLY FOR HIS SOLDIERS AND THREATENING TO PATCH EVERYBDNEY IN HIS DOMINENCE AT THE SAILORMAN WAS NOT RECAPTURED
